    <p>
        For each statistic on the administrative dashboard, the &quot;All Records&quot; column shows the total number of 
        records in the BHL database, and the &quot;Active&quot; column shows the number of records 
        that are visible to the public.</p>

    <p>
        The statistics shown on the dashboard are generated in real-time.&nbsp That is
        why an extra click is required to access all of the Name statistics, and why it takes
        a minute or two to generate each Name statistic.</p>
    <p>
        Note that the statistics shown on the Expanded Library Stats page are NOT generated 
        in real-time.&nbsp; That page shows statistics that are compiled on a weekly basis, so 
        they may not exactly match the statistics shown on the dashboard.</p>
