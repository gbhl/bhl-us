This folder contains samples of tab-separated data files that can be used to index specific BHL data 
entities for search.

The authors.txt, keywords.txt, and names.txt files contain by entity identifiers and metadata.  For 
example:

The items.txt and segments.txt files simply contain a list of identifiers.  The metadata for these
entities is retreived from the database during indexing.
