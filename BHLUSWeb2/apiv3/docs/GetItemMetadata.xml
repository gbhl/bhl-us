            A FURTHER STUDY OF VARIATION IN THE

            GOPHER-SNAKES OF WESTERN NORTH



            AMERICA



            BY



            JOHN VAN DENBURGH



            Curator, Department of Herpetology



            In August of last year the writer and Joseph R. Slevin pub-

            lished the results of a study of some three hundred specimens

            of Pitnophis from western North America^ Probably no one

            who has not undertaken such a study can realize the amount of

            time and effort necessary for gathering, analyzing, digesting,

            and formulating the data derived from such a mass of material

            as was involved in our earlier study of the garter-snakes of the

            genus Thamnophis. The time and effort expended were so

            great that in the subsequent study of Pitnophis the attempt was

            made to reach conclusions without so much attention to detail.

            The result was that, while the conclusions reached were valu-

            able and probably correct, as far as they went, they never have

            been satisfactory as a solution of the problems in variation and

            distribution offered by this genus. Further study of the data

            published in that paper indicated the probability tliat the snakes

            [Proc. 4th Ser.



            we had regarded as one subspecies, and called Pituophis caten-

            ifer annectens, were not all alike, but represented several cen-

            ters of geographic variation. It has seemed important to deter-

            mine whether this actually is so, and whether conclusions more

            satisfactory than those published could be attained by further

            study of the group.



            Such study required additional data. The color patterns of

            these snakes had not been considered in our former investiga-

            tion for the reason that published records seemed to show so

            much variation as to render them valueless as a means of clas-

            sification. Investigation of them now, however, shows that

            they do afford valuable data. Individual variation is great, but

            so are the average differences found in several geographic

            areas. The whole subject has been reopened, and the results of

            additional study are given in the present paper.



            Reverting to the former paper, it may be recalled that it was

            there shown that the gopher-snakes of western North America

            may be divided into two groups by the number of their gastro-

            steges. This is indicated in the following diagram, figure 1, in

            which the upper curve represents the gastrostege counts in the

            snakes we called Pituophis catenifer catenifer, while the lower

            curve shows the same data concerning those regarded as Pituo-

            phis catenifer annectens:

            As one proceeds south and east from the cool north coast

            regions toward the wami south coast and interior desert

            regions, the average counts gradually increase. Although the

            transition is gradual, these gastrostege counts are of great use

            in the separation of these snakes into the two groups which we

            then regarded as two subspecies.



            This same difference and relationship are shown when the

            combined gastrostege and urostege counts are charted for the

            two groups, as has been done in figure 2. In this chart the

            upper curve (1) represents the counts in the snakes we called

            P. catenifer catenifer, the middle curve (2) those for P. caten-

            ifer annectens, and the lower curve (3) the same counts for P.

            vertebralis. That there is a very real difference between the

            first group and the others is evident.



            Turning now to a consideration of ^he number of dorsal

            blotches between the head and tail (at a point over the anus),

            we find that the snakes which have fewer gastrosteges are not

            all alike. Those from near the coast have more blotches than

            those from the interior. The same is true of the snakes with

            more numerous gastrosteges. The coast snakes have more

            numerous blotches than those from the interior. Figure 3

            shows the number of blotches on the body in gopher-snakes

            from several geographical areas. The upper two curves (1

            and 2) represent the snakes with fewer gastrosteges, which we

            called Pituophis catenifer cataiifer. It will be seen that there

            is a marked difference between these two curves. The upper

            curve (1) represents the snakes from the coast valleys and

            ranges from Oregon to Santa Barbara County, California.

            The second curve (2) shows the number of blotches in the

            snakes of this group from the Klamath-Modoc region, the

            Sacramento Valley, the western slope of the Sierra Nevada,

            and the northern portions of the San Joaquin. The difference

            between these two curves points to the necessity of recognizing

            two subspecies here, a coast race, P. catenifer catenifer, and an

            interior race, P. catenifer heermanni.



            The third, fourth, fifth, and sixth curves charted in this

            figure 3 represent respectively snakes (3) from the San Diegan

            Fauna, (4) from the desert regions of CaHfornia, the southern

            San Joaquin Valley and Nevada, (5) from Utah, and (6)

            from Arizona. Curve 3 shows that the snakes from the coast

            of southern California have more blotches than those of any of

            the other regions where the gastrosteges are numerous. In this

            respect these snakes are like those from the northern coast, P.

            catenifer catenifer, from which, however, they differ in other

            respects. The difference betw'een these snakes and those repre-

            sented by the other curves necessitates recognition as a distinct

            subspecies, P. catenifer anncctens, using this name in a re-

            stricted sense.

            Vol. X] VAN DENBURGH— VARIATION IN GOPHER-SNAKES 5



            The sixth curve, representing the snakes of Arizona, also

            shows marked difference from all of the others of this group.

            The number of blotches is much reduced and is similar to that

            found in Pituophis vertehralis, shown in the seventh curve. It

            would seem that the Arizona snakes also are entitled to sub-

            specific rank.



            This leaves curves 4 and 5, which agree with each other and

            with curve 2. Bearing in mind the fact that the snakes of

            curve 2 {P. c. hcermanni) belong to the group having fewer

            gastrosteges, it seems necessary to regard those represented by

            curves 4 and 5 as deserving separate standing.



            It will be shown later that the snakes of Utah (curve 5)

            differ from those represented by curve 4. For the latter, the

            name P. catenifer deserticola would seem to be available.



            The number of blotches on the tail in these various races has

            been charted in figure 4. The same differences and relation-

            ships as are indicated by the blotches on the body are shown

            by these data.



            Turning now to a consideration of the scale-rows we find that

            the greatest number present on the body, although subject to

            great individual variation, also shows geographic variation.

            This is brought out in figure 5. Curves 1 and 2, representing

            P. c. catenifer and P. c. heermanni, agree in showing 31 rows

            as the most frequent number. The Ari^na specimens (curve

            6) and those of P. c. amiectens (3), and P. c. deserticola (4)

            agree, and show 33 as the most frequent number. P. verte-

            hralis (curve 7) stands by itself in having 35 rows as the usual

            number. At the other extreme stand the Utah (curve 5) speci-

            mens, of which only 25 per cent have as many as 31 rows, while

            the majority have only 29. These Utah snakes are thus quite

            different from typical P. c. deserticola.



            In figure 6 are charted the number of urosteges in specimens

            of these several races. Curves 1 and 3 are of interest as show-

            ing that P. c. annectens (3) usually has more urosteges than

            P. c. catenifer or any of the other races. Curve 4 indicates a

            reduction in the number of urosteges in P. c. deserticola as com-

            pared with Utah specimens and P. c. heermanni.



            In work upon groups such as this, where individual variation

            is so great as almost to conceal geographic differences, I have

            found that the latter may be thrown into greater relief by what

            I have called a summation of characters. Individual variation

            in any one specimen rarely affects greatly all of the characters

            involved in geographic variation. Therefore, by adding to-

            gether, or subtracting various characters showing geographic

            differences, the factors of individual variation are proportion-

            ally reduced or buried, and geographical variations are less

            concealed.



            Figure 7 represents this principle as applied to certain charac-

            ters of the gopher-snakes. The number of dorsal and caudal

            blotches together has been subtracted from the number of gas-

            trosteges for each specimen. Certain differences between the

            subspecies become at once evident. P. c. annectens (curve 3)

            stands out as very distinct from P. c. deserticola (4) and the

            snakes of Arizona and Utah (5 and 6). P. c. heermanni (2) is

            also clearly different from P. c. deserticola (4). The Arizona

            snakes (6) plainly are not like those of Utah (5), nor like the

            Lower Californian P. vertehralis (curve 7).



            Still other differences between various subspecies exist but

            have not been charted. Thus, the snakes of Utah and Arizona

            most frequently have but one preocular, vr'hile the other races

            usually have two. In P. vertehralis the supralabials usually are

            nine, while eight is the number most frequent in the other races.



            It seems, then, that instead of the three kinds of gopher-

            snakes which have been recognized by authors for many years,

            the facts will be best set forth by according recognition to seven

            kinds from western North America. The chief differences be-

            tween these may be briefly set forth in the following table of

            averages. The complete scale-counts and localities are given

            in the earlier paper. The counts of the blotches are given here

            under the head of each subspecies with the numbers of the

            specimens and of the localities as in the former paper.

            Where individual variation is so great in races which inte-

            grade and are so closely related, it probably is impossible to

            make a "key" which will properly refer all specimens. How-

            ever, it is believed that the following synopsis will serve this

            purpose for most individual specimens, and perhaps for all

            series of specimens from one locality.



            Synopsis of Species and Subspecies



            a. Coloration on anterior half of body not largely red.



            b. The number of gastrosteges less the number of dorsal blotches on

            Pituophis catenifer catenifer (Blainville)

            Gsast Gopher-Snake



            Diagnosis. — Gastrosteges average fewer than 225 ; urosteges

            average 64 to 70; scale- rows most frequently 31; preoculars

            usually two ; supralabials most frequently eight ; dorsal blotches

            numerous, average on body 70, on tail 21.4; no red in colora-

            tion.



            Type locality. — California.



            Distribution. — The Coast Gopher-Snake occupies a rather

            narrow strip of territory along the Pacific Coast of the United

            States from Puget Sound to Santa Barbara County, California.

            The eastern limit of its range in the far north is not known, but

            does not include eastern Washington.



            In southern Oregon, it occurs near Roseburg and in the

            Camas Mountains, in Douglas County, but not near Klamath

            Falls, Klamath County, where it is replaced by P. catenifer

            heermanni.



            In California, it occupies the coast ranges and valleys east to

            the western edges of the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys,

            where it intergrades with and, farther east, is replaced by,

            P. catenifer heermanni in the north and P. catenifer deserticola

            in the south. Still farther south, it probably intergrades with

            P. catenifer annectens in Santa Barbara or Ventura County.

            It has been taken in Siskiyou (Ft. Jones, Callahan, Mt. Shasta),

            Humboldt (Garberville), Trinity (Yolla Bolly Mountain),

            Mendocino (ten miles south from Willits), Lake (Middletown,

            Utah Gopher-Snake



            (Plate 2, fig. 1)



            Diagnosis. — Gastrosteges average more than 230; urosteges

            average 60 to 66; scale-rows most frequently 29; preocular

            most often single; supralabials usually^eight ; dorsal blotches

            fewer, average on body 58, on tail 16.5; no distinct red in

            coloration.



            Type. — Cal. Acad. Sci. No. 14203, adult male, collected by

            Joseph C. Clemens, at Fort Douglas, Salt Lake County, Utah,

            June to July 4, 1908.



            Description. — Head somewhat flat-topped, with snout pro-

            jecting and rather narrow. Temporal regions not swollen.

            Rostral plate very large, prominent, not very narrow, often re-

            curved between internasals on top of snout ; bounded behind by

            internasal, anterior nasal, and first labial plates. Plates on top

            of head are a pair of internasals, a variable number of pre-

            frontals (normally four), a frontal, supraocular of each side,

            and a pair of parietals. Anterior and posterior nasals usually

            distinct. Loreal usually elongate. Preoculars usually one, oc-

            casionally two. Postoculars usually three, often two. Supra-

            labials usually eight, often nine. Infralabials usually 13, often

            12, sometimes 11 or 14. Temporals of first row varying from

            two to five, usually four. Genials in two pairs, anterior larger.

            Scales on body in 27 to 33 rows, usually 29, keeled except in a

            varying number of rows on each side. Anal plate not divided.

            Gastrosteges varying in number from 223 to 241, males having

            from 227 to 241, females from 223 to 240. Urosteges in two

            series of from 55 to 71, males having from 58 to 71, females

            from 55 to 62.



            The ground color is pale brownish or grayish-yellow, some-

            times more or less obscured by the spreading of the blotches

            or the presence of black or dark browh marks along the keels

            of its scales. Along the middle of the back, from the head to a

            point over the anus, is a series of from 50 to 68 (average 58)

            dark blotches. These blotches are brown on the central part of

            the body but are black anteriorly and posteriorly. On the

            upper surface of the tail are from fourteen to twenty (aver-

            age 16.5) blackish blotches. On the anterior portion of

            the body the blotches are more or less rounded, but posteriorly

            they tend to become quadrate. There are several series of

            alternating, often more or less confluent, dark blotclies or spots

            on the sides. Across the top of the head, between the preocular

            plates, is a moderately narrow brown band, very definite and

            well-defined. There are similar bands or spots below the cen-

            ter of the eye and running back and down from the upper post-

            ocular plate. The top of the head posteriorly has a few, small,

            scattered, dark spots. The spaces between the dark dorsal

            blotches on the posterior portion of the body are yellow or

            orange-yellow, usually somewhat obscured by dark brown

            streaks along the keels of the scales. The lower surfaces are

            yellow or yellowish-white with irregular spots or blotches of

            dark brown or black on the gastrosteges and urosteges. There

            is no definite median subcaudal black band.



            Variation. — Twenty-nine specimens from Utah show the

            following variations : The loreals are 1-1 in all. The preocu-

            lars are 1-1 in twenty-one, or 87% ; and 2-2 in three, or 13%

            31 in seven, or 26% ; and 27 in five, or 18% ; the average is 29

            rows. The gastrosteges vary in number from 223 to 241,

            males having from 227 to 241, females from 223 to 240; the

            average in twenty-two males is 233, in five females, 235. The

            The dark blotches between head and anus in twenty-nine

            specimens vary from 50 to 68, the average being 58. On the

            tail they vary from 14 to 20, and average 16.5. The counts of

            the blotches are given in full below.



            Distribution. — Specimens of this subspecies are at hand from

            Thompson, Grand County, Wasatch Mountains, Wasatch

            Walla Walla County, Washington, may belong here rather

            than with P. catenifer deserticola, but their final disposition

            must await additional material. They have twenty-nine and

            thirty-one scale-rows and one or two preoculars (50% each),

            and gastrosteges from 23 1 to 244.



            Pituophis catenifer rutilus, new subspecies



            Arizona Gopher-Snake



            (Plate 2, fig. 2)



            Diagnosis. — Gastrosteges numerous, average more than

            225 ; urosteges average 57 to 63 ; scale-rows most frequently

            33 ; preocular normally single ; supralabials usually eight ; dor-

            sal blotches very few, average on body 46, on tail 12.5 ; colora-

            tion often somewhat reddish posteriorly.



            Type. — Cal. Acad. Sci. No. 33869, adult female, collected

            jecting and rather narrow. Temporal regions not swollen.

            Rostral plate very large, prominent, not very narrow, often re-

            curved between internasals on top of snout ; bounded behind by

            internasal, anterior nasal, and first labial plates. Plates on top

            of head are a pair of internasals, a variable number of pre-

            frontals (normally four), a frontal, supraocular of each side,

            and a pair of parietals. Anterior and posterior nasals usually

            distinct. Loreal usually elongate. Preocular usually one, oc-

            casionally two. Postoculars usually three, often four, some-

            times five. Supralabials usually eight, often nine, rarely 10.

            or the presence of dark keels on the scales, especially laterally

            and anteriorly. Along the middle of the back, from the head

            to a point over the anus, is a series of from 37 to 55 (average

            46) reddish-brown blotches. The brown of these blotches be-

            comes darker and redder posteriorly. These blotches often are

            margined with black. On the upper surface of the tail are from

            ten to fourteen (average 12.5) dark reddish-brown blotches or

            cross bands. On the anterior part of the body the blotches

            tend to be more or less rounded, posteriorly they are more

            quadrate, or are wider with concave anterior and posterior bor-

            ders. There are two or three series of alternating, often more

            or less confluent, dark blotches or spots on the sides. Across

            the top of the head between the preocular plates is a narrow

            brown band, more or less obsolete in adults. There are similar

            bands or spots below the center of the eye and running back

            and down from the upper postocular plate. The top of the head

            is light brownish-yellow, speckled with black. The spaces be-

            tween the dark dorsal blotches on the posterior part of the body

            are light yellowish or grayish-orange, usually without dark

            marks on the keels of the scales. The lower surfaces are yel-

            low or yellowish-white, with irregular spots or blotches of

            light or dark brown on the gastrosteges and urosteges. There

            is no definite median subcaudal dark band.

            222 to 258, males having from 222 to 237, females from 227

            to 258; the average in six males is 227, in nine females, 237.

            The urosteges vary from 52 to 68, males having from 57 to 68,

            females from 52 to 60; the average in six males is 63.5, in nine

            females, 57.



            The dark blotches between head and anus in 16 specimens

            vary from 37 to 55, the average being 46. On the tail they

            vary from 10 to 14, and average 12.5. The counts of these

            blotches are given in full below.



            Distribution. — I have examined specimens of the Arizona

            Gopher-Snake taken at Yuma, Yuma County, the Colorado

            River above Bill Williams River, Mohave County, Cave Creek,

            Maricopa County, Fort Lowell and the Santa Cruz River

            near Tucson, Pima County, and the Huachuca Mountains,

            Cochise County, Arizona. Specimens of Pituophis from Ari-

            zona have been recorded as collected at Oak Orchard, Camp

            Grant, Wilton Springs, Tucson, Gila River, White River Can-

            yon, Fort Whipple, Grand Canyon, and at Las Gijas in Pima

            County.



            Remarks. — The specimens from Mohave and Yuma counties,

            and a specimen from Silsbee, Imperial County, California (re-

            ferred to P. c. deserticola) show more or less intergradation

            between the Arizona and the Desert Gopher-Snakes. These

            specimens have very many gastrosteges, while those from ex-

            treme southeastern Arizona have fewer. Indeed, some of the

            latter have so few as to indicate intergradation with the gopher-

            snakes of New Mexico which Ruthven has referred to P. c.

            sayi, but which may possibly require recognition as a distinct

            subspecies, P. sayi dlinis (Hallowell).

            Habits. — Ruthven states that a large specimen, secured near

            Tucson about sun-down on August 22, had recently swallowed

            an adult ground squirrel. These snakes live both on the desert

            plains near sea level and in mountain canons to an altitude of

            at least 5,300 feet.

            specimens vary from 57 to 67 ; the average being 62 ; two males

            average 63, and three females, 60.



            The dark blotches between head and anus in six specimens

            vary from 39 to 48, the average being 44. On the tail in six

            specimens they vary from 10 to 12, and average 11.

            DESCRIPTION OF A NEW SPECIES OF RATTLE-

            SNAKE (CROTALUS LUCASENSIS) FROM

            LOWER CALIFORNIA



            BY



            JOHN VAN DENBURGH



            Curator, Department of Herpetology



            The first specimens of the diamond rattlesnake of the Cape

            Region of Lower California were sent from Cape San Lucas

            by John Xantus. Cope recorded them, in^861, as Caudisona

            atrox sonoraensis, but remarked that they were more delicately

            tinted than Sonoran specimens, the dorsal rhombs being more

            perfect and their yellow borders brighter. A considerable

            number of specimens have been collected in southern Lower

            California in more recent years, and have been recorded usually

            as C. atrox. The differences in coloration, however, seem to be

            of such constancy as to make it desirable to regard the San

            Lucan snakes as a species distinct from both C. atrox and the

            reddish C. exsul. I, therefore, propose for this snake the name



            Crotalus lucasensis, new species

            (Plate 3, fig. 1)



            Diagnosis. — Similar to C. atrox (Plate 3, fig. 2) but colora-

            tion brighter, much less punctulate, and with dorsal rhombs

            more completely enclosed in light borders.

            Type. — Cal. Acad. Sci. No. 45888, collected by Joseph R.

            Slevin at Agua Caliente, Cape Region of Lower California,

            July 26, 1919.



            Distribution. — The southern portion of Lower California,

            Mexico.



            Description of type. — Large. Head broad, fiat-topped ; ros-

            tral higher than wide, in contact with anterior nasal. Two

            nasals ; two preoculars ; three postoculars ; two loreals. Supra-

            ocular large, not raised into a horn-like process, separated from

            its fellow by about six or seven irregular rows of scales. Six-

            teen and seventeen superior and nineteen inferior labials, the

            first pair of the latter divided horizontally as in C. exsul. A

            single pair of genials. About five rows of scales between

            supralabials and eye. Scales in twenty-seven rows, keeled ex-

            cept in one or two rows on each side. Gastrosteges 186;

            urosteges 26.



            The general color is yellowish-brown, or brownish-yellow,

            with a series of large, darker brown blotches along the back.

            These blotches are well defined, are usually enclosed in con-

            tinuous light borders laterally as well as dorsally, and show

            little of the punctulate or pepper-and-salt style of coloration so

            characteristic of C. atrox. The sides are clouded or blotched

            with brown, more or less indefinitely outlined with light yellow

            or white. The head is somewhat mottled above. A yellow or

            white stripe runs across the side of the face from the preocular

            plates to the mouth. The scales behind and above this light

            stripe are darker than the ground color and are set off pos-

            teriorly by a light streak which runs down and back from the

            corner of the mouth. The tail is grayish with about four to six

            black cross-bands. The lower surfaces are yellowish-white.



            Length to anus 1070 mm.



            Length of tail to base of rattle 90 "

            DESCRIPTION OF A NEW SUBSPECIES OF BOA

            (CHARINA BOTT^ UTAHENSIS) FROM UTAH



            BY



            JOHN VAN DENBURGH

            Curator, Department of Herpetology



            The existence of boas of the genus Charina in Utah was re-

            corded by Mr. Slevin and myself in 1915. These snakes then

            were regarded as identical with the snakes of the Pacific Coast.

            Further study shows that, while the boas of these two areas

            are alike in almost every respect, they differ in the number of

            scale-rows. The specimens from Utah all have 41 rows of

            scales, while this number is found very rarely in the snakes

            from the Pacific states. However, since an occasional speci-

            men from the latter region has only 41 rows, it seems best to de-

            scribe the Utah snakes as a subspecies.



            Charina bottae utahensis, new subspecies



            Diagnosis. — Similar to Charina hottce bottcE but with scales

            in only 41 rows.

            32 CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES [Proc. 4th Ser.



            Distribution. — Northwestern Utah, also Idaho.



            Remarks. — The seven specimens at hand from Utah all have

            41 rows of scales. The same number of rows is found in two

            specimens from Blue Lake and Hood's Valley, Kootenai

            County, Idaho, which may be regarded as belonging to this

            subspecies. The only other specimens with 41 rows of scales

            of which I have record are one from Red Point, Placer County,

            California, and one from Fyffe, El Dorado County, California.

            These are to be regarded as instances of individual, or possibly

            geographical, variation in Charina hotter bottcu, for other speci-

            mens from the same localities have 43 rows. It is these two

            Califomian specimens which cause me to regard the two forms

            as subspecies rather than species. All other specimens from

            California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington, of which I have

            records, have more than 41 rows of scales. Thus, of forty-

            seven specimens from these states, fifteen have 43 rows, twenty

            have 45, six have 47, and six have 49 rows. A specimen in the

            Paris Museum is said to have 43 to 45 rows and to be labeled

            "Utah Terr". In the light of the present evidence it seems

            probable that this locality is erroneous.

            DESCRIPTION OF A NEW LIZARD (DIPSOSAURUS



            DORSALIS LUCASENSIS) FROM LOWER



            CALIFORNIA



            BY



            JOHN VAN DENBURGH

            Curator, Department of Herpetology



            The Crested Lizard, Dipsosaiiriis dmsalis, occurs in the

            desert regions of California, southern Nevada, and western

            Arizona, and ranges thence south to the end of the peninsula of

            Lower California. It is one of the few reptiles found both in

            the Cape Region and farther north in which specific or sub-

            specific differentiation has not been recognized by name. Geo-

            graphic variation, however, does occur, as will be shown below.

            Since the species was originally described from a specimen

            from the Colorado Desert, California, that form may be known

            as Dipsosaunis dorsalis dorsalis, and the southern subspecies

            may be described as



            Dipsosaurus dorsalis lucasensis, new subspecies



            Diagnosis. — Similar to D. dorsalis dorsalis but with rostral

            usually separated from nasal by but one granular scale.

            Type. — Cal. Acad. Sci. No. 46090, collected at San Jose del

            Cabo, Lower California, Mexico, by J. R. Slevin, July 31, 1919.



            Distribution. — The Cape Region of Lower California.



            Remarks. — These two subspecies seem to be alike in all im-

            portant characters, except the one mentioned. This difference

            is not a constant one, but exists in so large a proportion of the

            specimens that it seems best to recognize it by name. The fol-

            lowing table shows the number of specimens which have each

            number of granules at the point where there are fewest on each

            side of the head :



            It will be seen that these granules are 1-1 in 78% of the 351

            specimens of D. dorsalis lucasensis as against 10% of 206 speci-

            mens of D. dorsalis dorsalis, and are 2-2 in 15% of the speci-

            mens of D. dorsalis lucasensis as against 83% of those of D.

            dorsalis dorsalis.

            Charles P. Alexander, Urbana, Illinois



            In a small collection of crane-flies belonging to the California

            Academy of Sciences and sent to the writer for naming by

            Mr. E. P. Van Duzee were included a few new species that

            are discussed in this paper. The types of all the new species

            are contained in the collection of the California Academy, un-

            less stated otherwise. I am greatly indebted to Mr. Van Duzee

            for the privilege of examining these highly important collec-

            tions.

            Female. — Length, 5 mm. ; wing, 7 mm.



            Rostrum and palpi dark brown. Antennae black throughout. Head dull

            brownish gray.



            Mesonotal prsescutum brown with three broad dark brown stripes ;

            tuberculate pits and pseudo-sutural fovea; black, the former located at the

            level of the anterior ends of the latter; remainder of the mesonotum

            brownish gray. Pleura dull gray ; two conspicuous tufts of long, light

            yellow hairs on the meso-pleura, the more dorsal of these lying between

            the bases of the wings and halteres. Halteres conspicuously light orange-

            yellow. Legs with the coxse dull gray; remainder of the legs dark brown,

            the femora clothed with sparse, pale, appressed hairs. Wings brownish

            gray, the disk variegated with paler ; base of the wing, costal and sub-

            costal cells more yellowish ; cell 2nd Ri beyond the stigma pale ; veins dark

            brownish black. Venation: Sci ending opposite r; Sc2 far from the tip of

            Sci, the distance on R between the origin of Rs and Sc2 being a little less

            than Ri beyond r; r about equal to the section of R2 before it; cell 1st Mi

            closed, long and narrow; basal deflection of Cui at about one-third the

            length of cell 1st M2. Anal veins convergent, the 2nd anal vein being

            sinuous on its outer end.



            Abdomen dark brown, the lateral margins with conspicuous light yellow

            hairs. Ovipositor with the tergal valves strongly upcurved.



            Habitat. — Washington.



            Holotype, 5 (No. 719), Paradise Valley, Mt. Rainier, alti-

            tude 5000-6000 feet, July 29, 1919 (C. L. Fox).



            Ormosia paradisea is allied to 0. arcuata (Doane) of the

            Eastern United States, but the coloration is darker through-

            out, Sc2 closer to the origin of Rs than to the tip of Sci, and

            other characters.



            Genus Rhabdomastix Skuse

            Subgenus Sacandaga Alexander



            The species discussed below is the fourth Nearctic form to

            be described. It should be noted in passing that the two Euro-

            pean species of Gonomyia, G. schisfacca (Schummel) and G.

            l(Bta Loew, are in reality members of this genus and subgenus.



            2. Rhabdomastix (Sacandaga) fasciger, new species



            General coloration brown, the pleura gray; wings grayish,

            the stigma brown ; an indistinct brown fascia along the cord ;

            abdomen dark brown.



            Female. — Length, 7-8 mm. ; wing, 7.5-9 mm.



            Rostrum and palni dark brown. Antennse dark brown. Head gray,

            more brownish medially.

            Mesonotal praescutum brown without apparent stripes ; pseudosutural

            f ovese and tuberculate pits shiny black ; scutellum and postnotum sparsely

            gray pruinose. Pleura gray. Halteres pale, the bases of the knobs a

            little darker. Legs with the coxae dull brownish yellow ; trochanters dull

            yellow; femora yellow, the tips broadly infuscated; remainder of the

            legs pale brown, the apical tarsal segments darker. Wings with a con-

            spicuous gray tinge ; stigma oval, dark brown ; an indistinct brown fascia

            along the cord, extending to the fork of M ; extreme base of wing a little

            yellowish. Venation : Sc rather long, Sci ending at about three-fourths the

            length of the long sector, Sc2 removed some distance from the tip of Sci,

            Sci alone being about equal to r-m ; Rz short, sub-perpendicular to oblique

            in position, subequal to or shorter than r-m ; cell 1st AU slightly narrowed

            at its inner end ; basal deflection of Cui very oblique, inserted before mid-

            length of cell 1st Mi, the angle between Ciii and Ms strongly acute.



            Abdomen dark brown, suddenly narrowed or constricted on the ventral

            face at the base of the terebra. Ovipositor with the tergal valves very

            long and slender, the tips slightly expanded and upcurved; sternal valves

            much shorter.



            Habitat. — California.

            Paratopotypes, 3 9 's.



            It is possible, though scarcely probable, that this species is

            a member of the subgenus Rhahdomastix, the most northerly

            known species of which is found in Panama. Specimens of the

            male sex will be necessary to tell this.



            Tribe Limnophilmi



            Genus Limnophila Macquart



            Subgenus Neolimnophila, new subgenus



            Similar to Limnophila, s. s., diflfering as follows:



            Antennas with the four basal flagellar segments united into a

            compact, elongate-conical fusion-segment, there being but ten

            free flagellar segments beyond it. In the female sex the third

            and fourth of these fused segments are less distinctly united

            and a faint suture is sometimes evident between them. Pro-

            notum small, narrowed anteriorly; prosternum distinct, nar-

            rowed posteriorly, separating the pro-coxje. Wings with

            i?2+3 longer than J?2 alone, r being generally inserted on

            i?2+3 a short distance before the fork. Male hypopygium with

            the pleurites very long and slender, the two pleural appendages

            curved, the outer margin with several appressed teeth ; inner

            appendage short, blunt, fleshy, the surface covered with setiger-

            ous tubercles, two or three of the setae at the end of the ap-

            pendage being much longer and stouter ; at the base of the

            pleurites two elongate cylindrical arms, the larger of which is

            provided with rows of long, curved hairs. Gonapophyses ap-

            pearing as flattened plates with their caudal lateral angle pro-

            duced into a long, straight point.

            The curious Tipulid that is here made the type of the new

            subgenus, Neolimnophila, flies in the autumn and less com-

            monly in the spring and so may be expected to be double-

            brooded. The species ranges across the entire northern United

            States and Canada, to British Columbia and Alaska.

            1917 Limnophila subaptera Alexander, Canadian Entomolo-

            One female specimen in the collection undoubtedly belongs

            to this species although it differs considerably from the unique

            male type. This specimen may be made the allotype.



            Female. — Length, 16 mm. ; wing, 2.4 mm.



            General coloration light yellowish brown, the pleura with a faint grayish

            bloom. Legs comparatively stout, the coxae but little pruinose ; legs brown-

            ish yellow, the femora and tibiae scarcely darkened apically ; the terminal

            tarsal segments dark brown. Ovipositor with the tergal valves greatly ex-

            ceeding the sternal valves in length, slightly upcurved, the tips subacute.

            unique species, pilosclla (Osten Sacken). No other species had

            been definitely referred to this group until the description of

            Ulomorpha sicrricola Alexander (1918). It is therefore of

            very great interest to record three additional species of this

            curious genus from the mountains of California. The rela-

            tionships of this genus with EulimnophUa Alexander, indicated

            by Osten Sacken in the generic characterization, have been

            amply and strikingly shown by the discovery of the immature

            stages of Ulomorpha pilosclla and several species of Eulimno-

            phUa (tennipes, recondita, quadrata).



            All three of the new species show marked peculiarities of

            structure or color. U. qiiinqiic-cellula is the only species with

            cell Ml present, i. e., with five posterior cells: U. nigronitida is

            notable by its intense shiny black coloration ; U. vandiizcei has

            the macrotrichise of the wing-membrane almost confined to the

            areas beyond the base of the sector and thus approaches, in this

            respect alone, the genus Adclphomyia Bergroth.

            April 27, 1919 (E. P. Van Duzee).



            This interesting little species would seem to be allied to

            Tipula heatula Osten Sacken. Its closest relative is T. bituber-

            culata Doane, in which species the abdomen of the female is of

            normal length.



            9. Tipula evidens, new species



            General coloration shiny obscure yellow, the prsescutal stripes

            scarcely apparent; antennal flagellum dark brownish black;

            wings grayish subhyaline, the costal region more yellowish;

            abdomen yellow, tergites two to five with conspicuous rounded

            black spots along the lateral margins, basal sternite with a con-

            spicuous rounded black median spot; male hypopygium large,

            the ninth tergite very extensive with two obtuse submedian

            and two longer sublateral lobes ; eighth sternite with two

            brushes of rather short yellow hairs.



            Male. — Length about 14 mm.; wing, 15.5 mm.



            Frontal prolongation of the head rather long, light brown, slightly darker

            at the base ; palpi dark brown. Antennae moderately elongated, if bent

            backward, extending about to the wing-root; scape and basal half of the

            first flagellar segment obscure yellow the remainder of the flagellum dark

            brownish black. Head dull brownish yellow, the center of the vertex more

            brownish gray pruinose.



            Mesonotal praescutum shiny yellow with three indistinct reddish stripes,

            the surface covered with a sparse pollen ; remainder of the mesonotum

            obscure yellow. Pleura yellow. Halteres yellow, the knobs dark brown.

            Legs with the coxae obscure yellow ; trochanters yellow ; femora brownish

            yellow, the tips narrowly dark brown ; tibiae light brown ; tarsi darker

            brown. Wings grayish subhyaline ; cells C and Sc more yellowish ; stigma

            light brown ; an obliterative area extending from before the stigma across

            the inner end of cell 1st AU; veins brown. Venation: petiole of cell Mi

            a little longer than m.



            Abdomen yellow ; tergites two to five with a conspicuous black rounded

            spot on the lateral margins, on the second segment near mid-length, on

            the other segments close to the base of the segment ; sternites yellow, a

            conspicuous, rounded black spot on the first segment and less distinct

            marks near the posterior margins of segments two and three. Male

            hypopygium large. Ninth tergite very long and extensive, the caudal mar-

            gin with a deep median notch, the adjacent submedian lobes broadly

            rounded and with the inner margin set with small setigerous tubercles ;

            the sublateral margins of the tergites are produced caudad into much

            longer lobes, with the apices subtruncate, the notch between these and the

            submedian lobes rounded ; the dorsal surface of the tergite has a median,

            impressed line that continues cephalad, before the base cutting off a sub-

            triangular area. Ninth pleurite small but complete; outer pleural ap-

            pendage small, cylindrical or slightly clavate, pale, provided with long

            hairs; from the ventral proximal angle of the pleurite projects ventrad a

            short, blunt lobe that is provided with abundant crinite hairs that hang

            ventrad across the genital chamber. Eighth sternite with two brushes of

            rather short golden-yellow hairs on the posterior margin, contiguous, or

            even slightly decussate across the median line. Gonapophyses appearing

            as two long chitinized rods that lie parallel and close together, directed

            dorsad.

            tude 7000 feet, July 23, 1919 (E. P. Van Duzee).



            Tipiila cvidens is allied to T. megalahiata Alexander but dif-

            fers in the coloration of the antennae and in the structure of

            the male hypopygium. This species, together with most of the

            other species of the genus discussed in this paper, were sub-

            mitted to Mr. Cole for comparison with the Doane types and he

            reports this as very distinct from any of Doane's species in the

            Stanford University Collection. I am greatly indebted to Mr.

            Cole for his care and help in determining these relationships.



            10. Tipula megatergata, new species



            General coloration yellow ; antennal flagellum black ; meso-

            notal praescutum pale buffy yellow witTi three indistinct reddish

            brown stripes ; wings light gray, the costal region more yel-

            lowish ; abdomen obscure yellow ; male hypopygium very large

            and powerful, the ninth tergite tumid, with the lateral angles

            produced caudad into elongate, pointed lobes that are bent

            slightly dorsad at their tips ; ninth sternopleurite very restricted.



            Male. — Length about 18 mm.; wing, 16.5 mm.



            Frontal prolongation of the head yellow, the nasus small ; palpi obscure

            brownish yellow, the last segment dark brown. Antennse with the scape

            yellow, the first flagellar segment light brown; remainder of the flagellum

            black. Head reddish yellow, sparsely gray pruinose, with an indistinct,

            median, capillary brown line.



            Mesonotal prsescutum pale buffy yellow with three indistinct reddish

            brown stripes, the broad median stripe split by a broad grayish line;

            remainder of the mesonotum yellowish. Pleura yellow, sparsely yel-

            low pollinose. Halteres pale yellow, the knobs brown. Legs with the

            coxae and trochanters yellow; remainder of the legs broken. Wings light

            gray, cells C and Sc yellowish ; stigma pale brown ; a conspicuous obliter-

            ative streak extending from before the stigma across the wing into the

            base of cell Mt. Venation : Cell 1st Mj pentagonal, high ; basal deflection

            of A/i+2 longer than Nh+i.

            Abdomen obscure yellow, the basal segments brighter; caudal margin of

            the tergites narrowly ringed with paler; hypopygium reddish. Male

            hypopygium very large and powerful. Ninth tergite very powerful, tumid,

            the lateral angles produced caudad into elongate-triangular horns that are

            slightly twisted, the extreme tips acute, bent slightly laterad and dorsad ;

            the median notch is broadly U-shaped, on either side of the median line

            with a small, chitinized, flattened projection, the apices obliquely truncated.

            Ninth sterno-pleurite very restricted between the large ninth tergite and

            eighth sternite, the pleurite almost complete. Outer pleural appendage

            slender, clavate, pale, provided with long bristles. Gonapophyses project-

            ing from the genital chamber as straight chitinized rods. Eighth sternite

            with two brushes of short yellow hairs, one on either side of the median

            line; lateral angles produced proximad into pale, complex arms that are

            branched at their tips, the cephalic arm jutting backward underneath the

            ninth sterno-pleurite, the tip provided with a brush of hairs, almost like

            those on the caudal margin of the sternite.

            Tipula megatergata is closely allied to T. tcrgata Doane and

            T. sternata Doane, especially the latter, but differs in the details

            of structure of the male hypopygium.

            center of the dorsum of the first and second segments, and rather long

            white hair on the sides of the first three segments. Hypopygium black,

            extending about one-half its length below the abdomen, its lamellae black,

            slender, rather wide at base but abruptly narrowing and tapering to a

            slender point, not quite as long as the third antennal joint, fringed with

            delicate pale hairs on both edges and with two long black hairs at tip ;

            inner appendages small, black with a point at tip and a tuft of black hair

            near the base. Legs and feet black; fore and middle tibiae a little yellowish

            on upper surface of apical two-thirds; fore coxae with long white hair on

            their anterior surface ; fore basitarsi widened a little at tip into a small

            spur, making it a little concave below, a little shorter than the remaining

            four joints taken together, fourth joint very short. Calypters, their cilia,

            and the halteres yellow.

            Wings strongly tinged with blackish ; third and fourth veins bent so as

            to approach each other beyond the cross-vein, still nearly parallel at their

            tips.



            Female : Color and wings as in the male. Face wide with white pollen,

            through which the green ground color can be seen ; third antennal joint

            short, a little longer than wide, triangular ; the apical arista longer than the

            antennae. Front violet, narrowly blue or green just above the antennae and

            along the orbits ; fore coxse with shorter hair than in the male ; fore basi-

            tarsi not concave below, their tips not widened.



            Described from one male and three females taken at Hun-

            tington Lake, Fresno Co., California, July 9, 1919, at 7000 ft.

            elevation, by Edward P. Van Duzee.



            Holotype (No. 729), male, and allotype (No. 730), female,

            in the Museum of the California Academy of Sciences.



            This species is very much like P. mnndus Loew, but it is

            smaller and the female is more AVholly black, the male has the

            lamellae long and slender, while in mnndus they are small and

            rounded ; the inner appendages are small in this species and

            altogether black while in mnndus they are long and yellowish ;

            the third antennal joint is shorter in this than in mundns.



            2. Gymnopternus californicus, new species



            Male : Length, 3.2 mm. Face wide, covered with brown pollen. Front

            dark blue-green, almost black. Antennae black, third joint scarcely pointed

            at tip, about as long as wide. Orbital cilia wholly black.



            Thorax and abdomen greennish black, shining; hypopygium and its

            lamellae black, the latter small, crescent shaped, fringed with brown hairs.



            Legs and feet wholly black, the knees a very little yellowish ; middle

            tibiae with one bristle below and four above, all rather long and slender ;

            middle and hind femora each with one preapical bristle, the latter with

            rather long hair on the upper edge, which is longest near the base. Calyp-

            ters and halteres yellow, the former with black cilia.



            Wings tinged with blackish ; rather evenly rounded on the posterior mar-

            gin, the anal angle being rounded oflF, not at all prominent ; third and

            fourth veins a very little convergent at their tips, still the tips far apart.



            Female : Agrees with the male in color and in the form of the wings.

            The face is wider and a little more gray than in the male ; the hair on the

            upper edge of the hind femora is much shorter. The fore tibiae with a

            row of little bristle-like hairs on their upper surfaces which are quite con-

            spicuous ; there are also three or four longer bristles among these hairs.



            Described from 11 males and 18 females, taken at Hunting-

            ton Lake, Fresno Co., California, July 9, 1919, at 7000 ft. ele-

            vation, by Edward P. Van Duzee.

            Vol. X] VAN DU ZEE— NEW SPECIES OF DOLICHOPODIDM 49



            3. Gymnopternus convergens, new species



            Male : Length, 3 mm. Face wide, covered with dark brown, almost

            black, pollen. Front greenish black. Antennae black, third joint longer than

            wide, somewhat oval, the arista inserted above the tip; orbital cilia wholly

            black.



            Thorax and abdomen very dark green, shining, the latter with slight

            bronze reflections. Hypopygium and its lamellae black, the latter crescent

            shaped, fringed with brown hairs on outer edge.



            Legs and feet black, the fore and middle tibiae more brownish ; middle

            and hind femora each with two preapical bristles ; middle tibiae with two

            small bristles below and about six rather short ones above. Calypters and

            halteres brownish yellow ; the latter with yellow knobs and the former with

            black cilia.



            Wings tinged with brownish gray; third and fourth veins convergent

            towards their tips, which are rather close together; anal angle of wing

            rather prominent, the base of the wing being at right angles to the costal

            line; wing widest about half way from tip of fifth to tip of sixth vein, the

            hind margin being somewhat flattened from that point to the anal angle.



            Female : Color and form of wing about as in the male, but the anal

            angle of the wing is a little less prominent. The middle and hind femora

            have each two preapical bristles as in the male ; the face is a little wider

            and perhaps a little more grayish.



            Described from four males and five females taken by the

            writer at Wells, Nevada, June 6, 1915.

            TWO NEW SPECIES OF SYRPHID^ (DIPTERA)



            BY



            A. L. LOVETT



            1. Myiolepta carbicolor, new species



            Length 10 mm. Color black: face, legs and pile black,

            thorax shining blue-black; third segment of antennae light

            brown, arista black; wings dark smol&lt;y, veins black, halteres

            smoky brown.



            Male: Face projecting, shining black, except for tubercle covered with

            dense whitish pollen ; along eye margins and on greyish cheeks with sparse

            moderately elongate white pile ; frontal triangle shining black, bare ; ver-

            tical triangle black with elongate black bristle-like pile, the pile extending

            outward along occiput. Antennas brown, black at base, the third segment

            light brown, circular ; the arista moderately elongate, black.



            Thorax and scutellum shining metallic blue-black with moderately dense,

            elongate black pile. Abdomen sub-opaque black with translucent brown

            and blue reflections arranged as pseudo-crossbands on anterior margins

            of segments. Pile on disc inconspicuous, short, black, on lateral margins

            and on fourth segment longer, white.

            Another male from Paradise Valley (Mt. Rainier 5500 ft.),

            July 28, 1919, collected by C. L. Fox, in author's collection.



            This species is near aiiricaudata Will, and aurinota Hine, but

            the wholly black legs and pile distinguish it.



            2. Xylota bivittata, new species



            In size, general appearance, and abdominal markings similar to analis.

            Legs without spur on hind coxae. Antennse lighter in color, third segment

            yellow, arista black, longer than with analis. Face brown, light yellowish

            brown on lower half, pile white; contour of face similar to analis, more

            deeply concave in profile, oral margin more pronounced.



            Thorax with a pair of indistinct longitudinal vittse not reaching the

            scutellum. Pile of thorax shorter, more golden than in analis, crossband

            of black evident only in certain lights. Opaque black of second and third

            abdominal segments narrower, margined with brown ; yellow areas larger,

            quadrate, more as in stcbfasciata.



            Legs without spur on hind coxae, color markings similar to analis, the

            lighter areas more extended and honey-yellow ; front and middle tibiae

            except for brown ring, all tarsi except apical segments, honey-yellow.

            Wings similar to analis, apical cross-vein curved backward for a shorter

            distance and less abruptly ; halteres honey-yellow.



            Type, male (No. 735), in Museum of California Academy

            of Sciences, Huntington Lake, California, July 21, 1919; E. P.

            Van Duzee, collector.



            Paratype, male, in author's collection.



            Superficial characters throughout very similar to analis,

            abdominal markings resemble sitbfasciata. Light brown face,

            light antennae and absence of spur serve to differentiate it, and

            minor characters are specific.

            NOTES ON SOME UNDESCRIBED CALIFORNIAN



            HELICES



            BY

            S. STILLMAN BERRY



            Gradually accumulating material of the larger land snails

            of the Californian area enables the reeegnition. as so notorious

            in the case of the birds and mammals, of a considerable number

            of more or less strongly marked geographical races, descrip-

            tions of some of the more interesting of which are offered

            herewith. This paper is therefore to be taken as complementary

            to one published by the same writer in the University of Cali-

            fornia publications of a few years ago (Berry, :16). Unfor-

            tunately the earlier paper was not illustrated, as the figures pre-

            pared for it proved unsatisfactory for reproduction. The op-

            portunity is now taken, at least in part, to make good the

            deficiency.



            The writer's thanks are due to the various collectors here-

            after mentioned who have so generously aided him by supply-

            ing specimens, as well as to Mr. John Howard Paine for the

            remarkable photomicrographs w^hich constitute two of the

            plates.

            Epiphragmophora tudiculata allyniana, new subspecies



            (Plate 4, figs, la-lc)



            Diagnosis: Shell moderately thin, low-conic to depressed-

            globose, strongly umbilicate, the umbilicus narrow and steep-

            walled, but permeable to the apex and having a diameter of

            about one-eleventh the major diameter of the shell. Whorls

            about 6, convex, the last strongly inflated and somewhat de-

            scending in front. Aperture rounded, ample, and very oblique,

            its deflection about 40°. Edges of peristome converging and

            connected by a thin parietal callus. Periostracum quite glossy,

            but roughened over most of the later whorls by numerous fine

            incremental lines and a very fine, close malleation like small

            hammer dents, the latter becoming obsolete on the higher por-

            tions of the spire and in the immediate vicinity of the umbilicus.



            Color a dull cinnamon or Prout's brown, becoming yellower

            and paler in the umbilical region, and with a dark liver brown

            band of a width of about 1.5 mm. on the shoulder, bordered

            above and below by a light yellowish-brown band of about equal

            width with the dark band and with its mate opposite, or the

            lower in come cases a little the wider.

            Vol. X] BERRY—SOME UNDESCRIBED CALIFORNIAN HELICES 55



            Remarks: This large and fine race cannot be confused with

            any of the described subspecies of tudiculata, unless it be the

            E. t. imibilicata Pilsbry from San Luis Obispo County. The

            latter is likewise a relatively depressed, finely malleate, umbili-

            cate form, but is well distinguished from its Sierran relative by

            its smaller, less tumid, heavier, and much more solid shell,

            lighter color, more conspicuous banding, and more polished

            surface.



            Epiphragmophora traskii chrysoderma, new subspecies



            (Plate 4, figs. 2a-2c)



            Diagnosis: Shell as a whole depressed-conic in outline,

            moderately thin; whorls convex, the body whorl quite tumid.

            Umbilicus narrow, deep, little flaring, permeable; contained

            about eleven times, or a little less, in the diameter of the shell.

            Aperture only moderately oblique (30°). Peristome little

            thickened ; only slightly reflected except over the umbilicus,

            the circular outline of which it barely indents ; edges connected

            by a thin callus.



            Nuclear whorls worn in type, but in other specimens very

            finely papillose and radially wrinkled, with obliquely slanting

            lines of larger, more regular, distant papillae superimposed.

            Following whorls very finely wrinkle-papillose, usually more

            or less eroded. Growth lines as a rule comparatively weak, but

            stronger at sutures and becoming very strong on body of later

            whorls. Definite spiral sculpture hardly recognizable till latter

            part of fourth turn, but developing on fifth whorl into a some-

            what wrinkly system of incised spiral lines visible to the naked

            eye, though more or less cut up by the intersecting growth

            lines ; on the body whorl the whole complex strongly developed

            over its upper portion, becoming gradually weaker, but still

            very distinct, on the base.



            Periostracum very thin, strongly dehiscent and almost impos-

            sible to preserve in dry specimens ; very light golden brown

            (honey yellow of Ridgway) in color, sometimes showing

            streaks of a darker hue following the stronger lines of growth,

            but without any distinct spiral banding or other evident pat-

            tern. Shell beneath the periostracum pure white.

            Type Locality: Among loose talus on higher portion of

            southern end of South Coronado Island, Lower California;

            George Willett, December 13, 1918; 12 specimens.



            Remarks: The Coronado Islands have for long been the re-

            puted home of a snail belonging to the /;'a.y^//-group of Ephi-

            phragmophora which passed for many years as the Helix car-

            penteri of Newcomb, but Bartsch has lately reminded us that

            Newcomb's shell is almost certainly a mainland race of quite

            different affinities, and has therefore renamed the island sub-

            species coronadoensis (Bartsch, :16, p. 617), an action with

            which I am in accord. As there seemed to have been no collec-

            tions of coronadoensis made within recent years, and the exact

            island of the group from which it came in the first place is still

            uncertain, Mr. George Willett took advantage of a brief visit

            to South Island in December, 1918, to undertake a special

            search for this snail. At first only the common E. stcarnsiana

            (Gabb) was encountered, but finally in the southern part of the

            island, he found not only a thriving colony of what I take to be

            typical coronadoensis, but also a considerable number of speci-

            mens of the somewhat larger, pale-colored form here described.

            At the time, although found in a colony of its own, Mr. Willett

            took the latter to be merely an "albino" mutation of the other.

            This it may essentially be, but there are grounds, nevertheless,

            for believing that it represents considerably more than simply

            a sporadic variant.



            Some readers will no doubt recall, as a previous attempt to

            give systematic recognition to an albinistic variation of one of

            our Californian snails, the ill-fated Helix anachoreta of W. G.

            Binney. This is now considered by most authors, no doubt

            correctly, not to represent a fixed race, but to have been based

            on a chance light-colored variant such as is known to crop out

            ephemerally now and then in the race history of many diverse

            groups of organisms. Hence it has never been shown to inhabit

            any particular region or station, other than that regularly occu-

            pied by its "normal" prototype, E. nickliniana (Lea), or its

            occurrence to be any more than sporadic ; in other words it does

            not seem to have become hereditarily persistent anywhere.



            With chrysoderma it appears to be quite otherwise. In the

            first place, this light colored race, so far as the evidence goes,

            actually does constitute a definite colony in a definite locality

            and station on the island, as is indicated by "A" in the accom-

            panying rough sketch received from Mr. Willett, namely among

            loose talus high on the slopes near the southern end of the

            island. Typical coronadoensis, I understand, was taken more

            or less sparingly with it, but proved more abundant on grassy

            slopes lower down and nearer the end of the island, where

            chrysoderma failed to recur. In the second place, the differ-

            ences, though by no means great, appear to be fairly constant

            within the limits of the considerable series of both forms seen,

            and not confined to the dilution or lack of periostracal coloring

            alone. A comparison of the two series brings out the following

            special peculiarities of chrysoderma, — 1) the very thin,

            strongly dehiscent periostracum (an exaggeration of a feature

            already present in some degree in coronadoensis), 2) the

            notably larger average size*, 3) the light brozvnish-golden

            color of the periostracum, 4) the lack of spiral color bands of

            any description, and 5) the more tumid outline of the body

            whorl. Possibly also the umbilicus averages slightly wider.

            The animal is light bluish gray in color.



            Although I have recently described a curious little albinistic

            Vertigo (Berry, :19, p. 48), it was scarcely expected so soon

            to encounter another instance of an apparently hereditarily

            fixed albinism in a West American land snail. Very possibly

            both instances are more properly called albinoids than true



            * The largest of 12 fully matured coronadoensis measures: Maximum diameter 24.1,

            minimum diameter 20.0, altitude 15.7, diameter of umbilicus 2.1 mm.; whorls S^A. Tbe

            average values of all the dimensions are: Maximum diameter 22.86, minimum diameter

            18.95, altitude 14.78, diameter of umbilicus 1.87 mm.; whorls 5.60.

            albinos. The true nature of such forms among the Molhisca is

            not yet well worked out, although in any event they are of con-

            siderable theoretical interest. Very few races of snails are dis-

            tinguished by characters of such a nature as to strongly sug-

            gest their probable origin as sudden breaks or "mutations" of

            the DeVriesian type in the germ plasm of the ancestral fonn.

            But from the evidence at hand it appears quite reasonable to

            believe that the racial features of these two forms can be so

            regarded.

            (Plate 4, figs. 3a-3c)



            Diagnosis: Shell depressed-conic, conspicuously umbilicate,

            the umbilicus deep, permeable to the apex, and having a diame-

            ter about one-ninth to one-eighth the greater diameter of the

            shell. Whorls about 6&gt;4 or a trifle less, convex, the last de-

            scending somewhat in front. Aperture ample and very

            oblique (45°). Edges of peristome converging and connected

            by a very thin, transparent parietal callus. Lip but little thick-

            ened, everted somewhat throughout, but especially at the pillar

            where it is sufficiently reflected to indent somewhat the other-

            wise circular outline of the umbilicus.



            Color varying from near Prout's brown to tawny-olive, be-

            coming a little paler and yellower in the umbilical region, and

            with a clear-cut, deep, liver brown band of a width of about 2.2

            mm. on the shoulder, bordered below by a light yellowish band

            (near naphthalene yellow of Ridgway) of about equal width

            and above by a much narrower, slightly less clear-cut band of

            the same color.



            Periostracum somewhat glossy and with a peculiar sheen.

            Lines of growth very numerous and quite regular. First half

            whorl delicately hyaline and nearly smooth except for a few

            weak incremental waves, with a fine weak papillation sometimes

            Type: Cat. No. 4497, Berry Collection. Paratypes in pri-

            vate collection of George Willett.



            Type Locality: Alt. 3500 ft.. Pine Canyon, Sespe Creek,

            Ventura County, California; Geor§;e Willett, March 24, 1919;

            dead but fresh shells of 10 adults, and 14 juvenals of various

            stages, both living and dead, found in rock slides. One living

            and three dead adults taken at same locality in 1916 or 1917.



            Remarks: The shell of this beautiful snail is easily the

            largest, finest, and most richly colored of any of the traskii-

            group. In some respects it reminds one of the large mountain

            species, petricola, and like it has suffered a considerable reduc-

            tion in the spiral sculpture usually so characteristic of the snails

            of this group. Nevertheless I believe its relationships are

            rather with the true traskii, an opinion which is fortified by the

            color and general texture of the shell and periostracum, quite

            different from the light, SonercUa-Wkt gloss of petricola.



            The majority of the specimens are in an excellent state of

            preservation and are remarkably constant in their characters.

            They appear to represent an unusually well marked race, not

            especially near to any of the previously described subspecies.

            Its chief taxonomic features are the large size, depressed spire,

            wide umbilicus, weakly developed spiral sculpture (especially

            on the base), rich brown color, and prominent spiral banding.

            Dead shells of what appears to be the same subspecies are

            before me from Sespe Canyon above the mouth of Tar Creek,

            collected by Harold Hannibal, and from Matilija Canyon, col-

            lected by H. N. Lowe, in May, 1919. Both localities are in

            Ventura County.



            Epiphragmophora petricola orotes, new subspecies

            (Plate 4, figs. 5a-5d; plate 6)



            Diagnosis: Shell thin, translucent, depressed-conic, con-

            spicuously umbilicate, the umbilicus deep, permeable to the

            apex, and having a diameter about one-ninth the greater diame-

            ter of the shell. Whorls about 5^, convex, the last descending

            somewhat in front. Aperture oval and very oblique (45°).

            Edges of peristome converging and connected by a thin, very

            delicate, parietal callus. Lip but little thickened and only very

            slightly reflected save at the pillar, where it tends to cover the

            edge of the umbilicus.



            Periostracum more or less glossy, often showing quite a

            high polish. Lines of growth fine and numerous. First half

            turn weakly radially costate, with a few scattered papillse ; next

            three-fourths of a whorl finely, closely granulose, with fine,

            weak incremental costations, and, over all, traces of larger

            papillae; granulation present to some extent on all remaining

            whorls, but of diminished importance as compared with the

            suddenly much increased incremental lines and the papillae ;

            latter now seen to be ranked, at least primarily, in the usual

            obliquely retractively slanting series, almost quincuncially ar-

            ranged, but the appearance of regularity often lost ; maximum

            development of these papillae attained on the upper surface of

            the third whorl, still strong on the penultimate whorl, but prac-

            tically absent from the body whorl except along the suture and

            within the umbilicus; spiral sculpture very poorly developed,

            only a few interrupted traces of incised threading being dis-

            tinguishable on the upper third of the last two whorls, even

            these becoming entirely obsolete below.

            Color a warm golden brown, running fairly near a tawny-

            olive, becoming a little paler and yellower on the base, and

            with a conspicuous dark (liver brown) band of a width of

            about 1.5 mm. on the shoulder, bordered above and below by a

            rather narrower band of a few tints lighter than the body of

            the shell.

            part of this lot.)



            Remarks: This neat little helicoid is practically a miniature

            race of the large E. petricola Berry ( :16, p. 107), with which

            alone it would seem to require any special comparison. From

            this it differs not only in its much smaller size, but also in its

            thinner shell, more polished periostracum, and still further re-

            duction of the spiral sculpture. It occurs in the same general

            region of the San Bernardino Mountains as the typical form,

            but has only been discovered at localities farther into the moun-

            tains, at all of which it appears relatively constant and quite

            sharply separable from petricola.

            For purposes of comparison figures of the shell and micro-

            scopic sculpturing of the type specimen of pctricola are here

            appended (Plate 4, figs. 4a-4c; plate 5), especially as this

            species has recently been strangely misunderstood by Bartsch

            (: 16, p. 612), who referred it without qualification to E. traskii

            troskii (Newcomb). As a matter of fact very few of the

            numerous races described by him in the same paper have nearly

            the claim to separate recognition that petricola has, although I

            believe with him that most of them will stand. E. petricola is

            in fact the earliest described prototype of a whole series of

            southern Californian mountain snails, the exact relation of

            which to true traskii still remains to be determined. E. ::cchco

            Pilsbry ( :16), on the other hand, seems quite close to petricola.



            Both petricola and orotes are distinctly papillose over much

            of the upper surface. A very young petricola now at hand from

            the type locality (Cat. No. 3950, Berry Collection) shows that,

            when perfect, each papilla bears a minute, stubby, hair-like

            periostracal process.



            Epiphragmophora petricola sangabrielis, new subspecies



            (Plate 4, figs. 6a-6c)



            Diagnosis: Shell low-conic, thin, fragile, rather tumid, um-

            bilicate; the umbilicus rather narrow, barely permeable to the

            apex, and with a diameter about one-twelfth the greater diam-

            eter of the shell. Whorls 5&gt;4, convex, the last swollen and

            slightly descending in front. Aperture rounded, sometimes

            slightly flaring, oblique (40°). Edges of peristome slightly

            converging and connected by a very thin, transparent parietal

            callus. Lip only slightly thickened ; everted near the pillar so

            as to indent the circular outline of the umbilicus.



            Periostracum somewhat glossy, often with a strong satiny

            sheen or semi-iridescence. Lines of growth numerous and

            fairly strong, though somewhat irregular. First half whorl

            when unworn showing rather strong, more or less interrupted,

            incremental wrinkles, and traces of a strong, coarse, overlying

            papillation; succeeding turns very finely wrinkly-granulose be-

            neath the retractively slanting lines of small and at first often

            nearly obsolete papillae, the latter increasing in strength to the

            penultimate whorl where they are always strongly evident as

            well as within the umbilicus and to a less degree over the

            region just behind the aperture on the body whorl ; papillae

            elsewhere on the last whorl more weakly developed. Spiral

            sculpture obsolete, a few weak traces persisting on the upper

            surface and peripheral region of the body whorl only.



            Color light golden brown near buffy citrine, paler and with

            more of a yellow tone below, with a dark, liver brown band of

            a width of about 1.0-1.5 mm. on the shoulder, bordered above

            and below by a rather narrower band slightly lighter in tone

            than the body of the shell.

            sibly referable to the same subspecies. They are at any rate

            very close, although the material is still inadequate for entire

            certainty.

            Remarks: This mountain race appears to be somewhat

            similar to Bartsch's avus in shape, size, and the narrow um-

            bilicus, but differs in the zvcak papillation of the upper surface,

            and the presence of a weak spiral sculpture. From zcchce Pils-

            bry, it is distinguishable by its thinner, more tumid shell, much

            narrower umbilicus, and the better developed papillation of the

            upper whorls. None of the other described races appears to

            require any special comparison.

            A NEW GENUS AND SPECIES OF GRASSHOPPER

            FROM CALIFORNIA



            BY



            Morgan Hebard



            In the spring of 1917 (April 22-27), Mr. E. P. Van Duzee,

            curator of Entomology, Museum California Academy of

            Sciences, collected at Bryson in Monterey County, California.

            Among the material taken was a single specimen of grasshop-

            per, which seemed to represent an undescribed genus and

            species.



            Upon being informed of this fact, Mr. Van Duzee again

            visited Bryson, May 16-23, 1920, in order to obtain, if possible,

            additional material of the species. After considerable effort he

            was able to locate the habitat, and secured three additional

            specimens, all females.



            Esselenia,^ new genus



            The present genus shows a combination of characters which

            makes it most difificult to place. The form of the insect is more

            robust than that of any other North American Acridid ; in fact,

            it is of a type C|uite similar to that usual in the Ommexechinse.



            The head is as full, with face as perpendicular, as in Stira-

            pleura, the pronotum showing a generally similar construction

            of the lateral carinae. The lateral foveolfe of the vertex are,

            however, not visible from above, in this feature agreeing with

            Mesochloa and Phliho stroma, the vertex itself being as broad

            as in the latter genus and intermediate between them in show-

            ing a subobsolete medio-longitudinal carinula. The antennse



            ^ The small Esselenian tribe of Indians once inhabited the region from which this

            genus is known.

            [Proc. 4th. Ser.



            are relatively heavy and flattened, much as in Mesochloa and

            Cordillacris, though not showing the slightly greater flattening

            proximad found in those genera.



            The pronotum, with caudal portion of disk produced mesad

            and laterad and margin between concave, is distinctive. In

            Mesochloa and Psoloessa alone do we find mere traces of con-

            cavity of the lateral portions of the caudal margin of the pro-

            notal disk.



            The inner spurs of the caudal tibiae are almost equal in

            length, in this agreeing with Cordillacris, but not as long and

            slender as in that genus.



            The ovipositor valves are very short, as in all the other

            genera referred to above.



            Taking all into consideration, we believe that Esselenia

            should be placed after Phlibostroma, though further study of

            the proper order of the related genera may lead to its being

            placed near Stiraplciira. The system generally in use for the

            linear arrangement of the genera of the Acridinae is clearly un-

            satisfactory, but can not be rectified until extensive studies of

            the subfamily are made.

            Vol. X] HEBARD—A NEW GENUS AND SPECIES OF GRASSHOPPER 73



            Generic description : Size medium small, form extremely ro-

            bust for the Acridinae. Head large ; face vertical ; vertex wide,

            its surface weakly concave and showing a subobsolete medio-

            longitudinal carinula, its lateral margins slightly raised and

            carinate; lateral foveolas not visible from above; frontal costa

            decidedly concave throughout between the strong lateral

            carinae. Eye rounded, scarcely deeper than broad, more nearly

            circular in outline than in Stirapleura and much less elongate

            than in any of the other genera here discussed. Antennae short,

            moderately heavy, flattened. Pronotum with a distinct and

            percurrent medio-longitudinal carina, cut only by the principal

            sulcus; disk bounded laterad by distinct but irregular carinae

            which are weakly convex-convergent to first sulcus, thence

            straight and strongly divergent. Caudal margin of lateral lobes

            and of each half of disk broadly concave, so that the pronotum

            is roundly produced at each shoulder and more strongly so

            mesad on the disk. Tegmina represented by large lateral pads.

            Ovipositor very short. Interspace between metasternal lobes

            of female slightly over twice as broad as long. Dorsal surface

            of caudal tibiae with eight to ten spines on external margin.

            Internal spurs of caudal tibiae heavy, the ventral spur being

            only slightly longer than the dorsal.



            Esselenia vanduzeei, new species



            We refer to the figure of this distinctive insect, as we know

            of no other species showing sufficiently close agreement to

            enable us to make a brief comparative analysis.



            Type: Female, No. 736, Museum California Academy of

            Sciences; Bryson, Monterey County, California, April 27,

            1917; E. P. Van Duzee, collector.



            In addition to the characters described in the generic treat-

            ment, we would note the following : Lateral bounding carinae

            of vertex straight, very narrow and diverging from the sharply

            rounded apex, forming nearly a right angle, to a point above

            the lateral ocelli ; thence, for an equal distance, straight, broader

            and moderately converging to the point where they disappear

            into the rounded occiput.



            Cephalic margin of pronotal disk weakly convex, appreciably

            less than one-half the distance between the extremities of the

            caudal margin ; least width of disk about four-fifths the cephalic

            width. Surface of pronotal disk weakly tectate, moderately

            wrinkled, this decided toward the lateral carinse. Lateral lobes

            of pronotum with greatest depth equal to dorsal length;

            cephalic margin weakly convex and scarcely oblique to the ob-

            tuse-angulate, sharply rounded ventro-cephalic angle, ventral

            margin broadly convex to the rather broadly rounded, rect-

            angulate, ventro-caudal angle; caudal margin broadly concave;

            sulci deeply impressed on lateral lobes.



            Tegmina represented by broadly lanceolate pads with

            rounded apices, which are attingent (or weakly overlap), nearly

            as long as combined length of head and pronotum. Veins and

            cross-veinlets of tegmina heavy and distinct, forming a coarse

            and irregular network, in which, however, the principal veins,

            and particularly the humeral vein, are clearly defined.



            Short ovipositor valves with heavy apices sharply curved.

            Caudal femora heavy, the ventral and particularly the dorsal

            portions evenly and broadly lamellate, the lamellation of the

            dorsal margin being over half as wide as the external pagina.

            Head paling to hazel on occiput, cheeks tawny, this continued

            as a U-shaped band from eyes, its lower portion crossing the

            labrum, frontal costa and ventral portion of infra-ocular sulcus

            suffused with black. Antenn?e hazel, deepening to chestnut

            brown distad. Pronotum with median carina russet, bordered

            by a band of mars brown, lateral carinae buffy tinged with rus-

            velvety blackish brown, this surface flecked proximo-dorsad

            with this color also ; remaining distal portions pecan brown,

            suffused in genicular areas with blackish. Caudal tibise oppo-

            site genicular areas of caudal femora black, beyond this show-

            ing a broad buffy annulus, particularly distinct on the inner

            surface, remaining portions buckthorn brown, suffused distad

            with mummy brown ; proximal internal spines mummy brown,

            other spines and spurs buckthorn brown, tipped with mummy

            brown.



            One of the paratypes is similarly colored, except that the

            general coloration is much paler, walnut brown. Another has

            the color pattern much more strikingly defined, the blackish areas

            being as dark, but the medio-longitudinal band of head and pro-

            notum light ochraceous-tawny, the tegmina ochraceous-tawny

            except in the sutural half of the dorsal section and the proximal

            portions of the caudal femora light ochraceous-salmon. The

            remaining paratype is almost uniformly sayal brown in colora-

            tion, the dark triangle dorsad on the caudal femora remaining

            as the only trace of color pattern.



            In addition to the type, three female paratypes are before us,

            bearing the same data, but taken May 18, 1920. One of these

            is the property of the California Academy of Sciences, the other

            two are in the author's collection.



            In securing these paratypes, Mr. Van Duzee had some diffi-

            culty in locating the proper environment in which to search for

            the species. They were taken in the same canyon as the type,

            on the grassy or sandy borders of a small mountain stream.

            At the time there was no running water in the stream, but little

            pools with level sandy flats between and it was on one of these

            flats that all were located. The exact spot is in the canyon

            back of the Bryson school house, about two miles east of the

            Nacimiento River and the same distance north of the San Luis

            Obispo County line.



            The species probably reaches its greatest adult abundance in

            the early spring.



            We take pleasure in naming this singular species in honor of

            the ardent student and collector who discovered it and who has

            subsequently, not without considerable difficulty, secured addi-

            'tional material and valuable data as to the immediate environ-

            ment in which it occurs.

            COLOR CHANGES AND STRUCTURE OF THE SKIN

            OF ANOLIS CAROLINENSIS



            BY CHARLES E. VON GELDERN



            The mechanism of the color changes in the lacertilia has been

            the subject of much investigation, especially in that of the African

            Chameleon. One need only refer to the works of Briicke, Keller,

            and Fuchs for historical resumes. Briicke, Pouchet, and Keller have

            attempted to solve this problem by a close study of the histological

            structure of the skin and Keller was able to demonstrate clearly

            the various elements essential for the production of the various

            color states.



            The histological structure of the skin of Anolis has, as far as I

            have been able to determine, been studied only by Carlton, who

            attempted to correlate the findings of Keller in the chameleon

            with those in Anolis.



            The Anolis carolinensis , or so-called Florida Chameleon, belongs

            to the family Iguanidae and is in no way related to the true chame-

            leons. Its habitat is the southeastern part of the United States

            and Cuba. It may be distinguished from all other North American

            lizards except the Geckos, according to Ditmars, by the expanded

            and flattened adhesive pads on the middle four phalanges of each

            foot.



            It is entirely insectivorous, subsisting mainly on flies and meal

            worms, which it is able to capture with almost unerring accuracy.

            Water in the form of scattered droplets is lapped by means of its

            thick tongue and these lizards soon become dehydrated and die if

            water be not supplied in this form.



            A characteristic flattened, semicircular projection of the skin,

            known as the throat-fan (Ditmars), dewlap or gular appendage

            (Gadow), is produced at will in the mid- ventral region of the head

            and neck. This fan is produced by the hyoidean apparatus. The

            mechanism of this apparatus consists of a double, tapering car-

            tilage lying in the mid-ventral line and attached to the body of

            the hyoid just anterior to a line through the center of the eye.

            When erected, it carries the loose skin of the cervical region with

            it.



            This throat-fan is, according to Ditmars, purely ornamental

            and produced only by the males, being accompanied by a vigorous

            nodding of the head and neck.



            It is produced when a male spies a female or when it prepares

            for combat with another male. When the males are captured and

            held in the hand, this fan becomes prominent. Often when two

            males meet, each one will erect a ridge along the mid-dorsal line

            extending from the base of the occiput to a variable distance along

            the back. This may be accompanied by a marked lateral com-

            pression of the thorax and abdomen so that the lateral diameter

            is smaller than the dorso-ventral, whereas under ordinary condi-

            tions the reverse is true. The throat-fan is usually very prominent

            during this state and there is present a characteristic coloration

            which will be described later.



            The Anolis lives well in captivity when supplied with water in

            the form of scattered droplets and flies or meal worms. It soon

            becomes apparently very tame and will take insects from the

            fingers of its captor.



            Observations of Color Changes in the Living



            Anolis



            A general fact impresses itself after one has captured and

            observed many of these lizards in captivity, namely, that the range

            of variation in the color of the skin is by far greater in those animals

            which have been freshly captured. After a few weeks of captivity,

            although seemingly in perfect health, the color changes become

            less complicated and less brilliant. This observation may tend to

            explain the differences noted by different observers as to the color

            changes. Ditmars states that the color varies from different

            shades of brown to emerald green and that although these are the

            common hues of Anolis, other hues are striking, namely, golden

            yellow and slaty gray with the peppering of white spots over the

            back. These colors he believes occur during the transition from

            the two extremes, namely, brown and green. Carlton states that

            he has never seen any changes other than the different shades of

            brown to emerald green and bases his assirmption that the color

            changes are much more simple in Anolis than in the true chameleon,

            on the observations of Lockwood.



            To those observing these lizards in their natural environment,

            it is evident that the variation is not so simple as has just been

            noted. A slaty gray with no element of brown or green is of fairly

            common occurrence, as is also straw yellow.



            Furthermore over certain areas of the body the colors undergo

            even a greater variation than is ascribed to them by Ditmars.

            Over the mid-dorsal region, for instance, there is present in many

            of these lizards a narrow stripe of two or three millimeters in

            •width, extending from the cervical region to the sacrtim or even

            along the tail for a variable distance, in which further variations

            may be noted. That this stripe varies in different individuals is

            probable, and it may even be absent. Nevertheless, it is so char-

            acteristic of many specimens that a description of its changes

            should not be neglected. A bright pink color is often present

            along the stripe which may become darker until it assumes a

            brick-red color conveying the impression that there is placed

            there a thick pigment which does not belong to the skin. This

            stripe may also show a cream color or white, containing a faint

            suggestion of yellow or brown. This light color is most often

            observed in those lizards which have assumed the brown hue else-

            where on the body.



            When the mid-dorsal stripe assumes either a pink or a white

            stripe it is irregular at the edges and these irregular edges are dark

            brown. A less irregular, black stripe is often observed in the green

            state.



            I have been unable to discover any rule for the appearance of

            the dorsal stripe in its various states. It may be present or absent,

            brick-red, pink, white, or black in different lizards living under

            the same conditions, nor does the color state of the rest of the body

            influence the appearance to any extent. I believe that this stripe

            may appear at some time in all the animals in which it is absent,

            but that its appearance entails considerable change in the structiire

            of the skin so that its production must necessarily be a slow one.



            On the sides of the maxilla, posterior to the eye there may be

            present a black, quadrangular patch, measuring in large males

            about two by three millimeters. When present, this patch is of

            shiny black appearance and differs markedly from the rest of the

            body even in the dark brown state. This patch appears during

            the time when two males are preparing for combat and is asso-

            ciated with the appearance of the mid-dorsal ridge, the lateral

            flattening of the abdomen and thorax, the extension of the legs so

            that the body is raised off the ground, and by a peculiar greenish

            mottling of the skin. The altered appearance of this animal pre-

            paring for combat, in color, form and action, shows such marked

            changes, that it is difficult to associate it with the animal under

            ordinary conditions. Even the eyes, which ordinarily are fairly

            prominent, recede so that the palpebral fissures show only the

            pupils. The movements are slow and awkward and the body may

            sway from side to side in a most fantastic manner.



            In general, the peppering of white spots on the dorso-lateral

            aspect of the body is characteristic, especially during the brown

            state, and these spots may be confluent on the lateral aspect of the

            cervical region. The lower border of the maxilla, the entire man-

            dible, and the ventral aspect of the entire body varies from a

            snowy white to dirty brown, gray, or peppered with black dots.

            The throat -fan when extended is a brilliant pink or vermilion and

            over it are scattered many white spots. When relaxed, the skin

            of the throat region is somewhat cream colored or white with

            reddish streaks at times.



            The following table indicates the various colors noted in different

            specimens at the same time and in the same specimen at different

            a. White.



            b. White with scattered black spots.



            c. Dirty brown or gray.



            On comparing this table with that of Briicke for Chamceleon vul-

            garis, one notices certain differences. For instance, pale flesh

            colors, lilac gray, steel blue and purple are not present in Anolis,

            but the greater simplicity which Carlton would attribute to the

            latter is questionable. Undoubtedly differences exist but the

            changes must be just as complicated in one as in the other.



            Causes of Color Changes



            The most evident general factors influencing the color states

            are light, absence of light, temperature, and various external

            stimuli.



            Carlton found that with few exceptions the brown state was

            brought about from the green state in four minutes by exposure to

            sunlight. Absence of light changed the brown to green in twenty-

            five minutes. With specially constructed containers, he found

            that, with few exceptions, if part of the body of a green lizard,

            either head or body, be exposed to direct sunlight, while the rest

            remained in the dark, the entire body became brown.



            Carlton concludes that there are nerve terminals in the skin

            which are directly sensitive to light and which, when stimulated

            in one area, send impulses which reach the efferent nerve endings

            of the skin over the entire body. Spinal cord section in no way

            changed the results, indicating that the action is either wholly

            reflex in character, or that spinal nerves do not necessarily influence

            the changes. Carlton was able to induce the green state by in-

            jections of .001% nicotin solution in small quantities and this

            change from brown to green was brought about in one minute.

            This suggested to him that this change is under the control of the

            S3anpathetic nerves.

            He also found that the green state could be produced in three

            ways, namely, by subjecting the animals to the absence of light,

            by inhibiting the blood circulation, and by cutting off the nerve

            supply.



            Inhibiting the circulation, he found, was a more important

            factor than cutting off the nerve supply, in that it brought about

            more rapidly the green state and, furthermore, when both factors

            acted simultaneously, still greater rapidity in change occurred than

            when either one acted alone.



            Carlton believes that the green state represents the unstimulated

            state of the skin, which is suggested by the fact that ether narcosis,

            nicotin poisoning, and death are associated with the green state.

            The brown state, he believes, is brought about by stimulation of

            the nerve endings and represents "the state maintained through

            tonus established by the s&gt;Tn pathetic nerves and dependent upon

            stimulation of the nervous end organs in the skin by light."



            Parker and Starratt, repeating Carlton's experiments on the

            rapidity of change from one color state to another, obtained results

            that were not uniform and found that changes would occur more

            rapidly on one day than on another and even at different times

            during the same day.



            By means of a constant temperature apparatus which could be

            illuminated at 115 candle-meters and at the same time brought

            from io°C. to so°C., they found the average length of time at

            various temperatures at which either the brown or green state

            could be produced from the opposite color state. They found that

            at io°C., the skin remained brown in either light or dark, but as

            the temperature was raised to 2o°C., the animals placed in the

            dark became green in 19.66 minutes. At 25°C., under the same

            conditions, the change took place in 13.23 minutes; at 3o°C., it

            took 10.93 minutes; at 35°C., 15.48 minutes. At 4o°C. to 45°C.,

            the skin remained greenish gray to green in both light and

            darkness.



            On the other hand, when green lizards were placed in the light

            at 2o°C., the brown state was brought about in 4.23 minutes; at

            25°C., 3.52 minutes; at 3o°C., 3.13 minutes, and at 35°C., 2.8

            minutes.



            These investigators believe that at intermediate temperatures,

            namely, between 2o°C. and 3S°C., light is the controlling factor

            but that temperature is effective over this range is evident in that

            it may influence the rate of change.

            Vol. X] VON GELDERN—SKIN OF ANOLIS CAROLINENSIS 83



            Parker, in experimenting with Phrynosoma regale, found that

            the claw-like scales which fringe the lateral edge of the body be-

            came white when the animal was subjected to a temperature of

            32°C. and placed in the dark, and when placed in the light these

            claw-like scales became almost black. At i9°C., these scales

            became black in 15 minutes when the animal was placed in the

            light, and they became white in 30 minutes in the dark. At i5°C.

            light again caused black, while darkness brought about a light

            color, but not white. From these results he concluded that a low

            temperature favored the production of the black state, whereas a

            higher temperature, the white state. Thus light produces in this

            animal, as in Anolis, a dark state, while its absence brings about

            the light state.



            Parker further believes that even in Stellio, Uromastix, and

            Veranus, which have always been considered to have a reversal

            of the light reaction, in that light causes just the reverse effect

            as in Anolis, namely, the production of light coloration in the

            light and dark coloration in the dark, that the apparent reversal

            is really a temperature effect and not a true reversal of the effect

            of light.



            Parker and Starratt mention the observations of Doctor Caswell

            Graves who stated that in the neighborhood of Beaufort, N. C,

            on hot, sunny days about as many green lizards as brown ones

            may be captured. These results are explained by Parker and

            Starratt by considering that some of tlfe animals are more sensitive

            to light than to heat and thus become brown, while others are more

            sensitive to heat than to light and become green.



            I do not believe that this explanation suffices, for if one notices

            individual lizards for a considerable length of time, one is struck

            by the frequent and rapid changes from green to brown and back

            again to green, apparently regardless of temperature and light.

            How much influence the otherwise varying nervous conditions

            exert on these color changes, it is difficult to say for it would seem

            almost impossible to control them. I have watched animals which

            were sunning themselves and apparently undisturbed and quiet

            undergo these changes in a rhythmic manner. Rapid changes

            are also frequently noticed when an Anolis changes slowly from

            one object to another, the change occurring while the transfer is

            being made.



            Redfield, after nimierous carefully checked experiments on

            Phrynosoma cornutum, was able to verify the conclusions of Parker,

            Carlton, Starratt, and others that the daily rhythmic changes of

            color are produced by the direct action of light and heat upon the

            melanaphores. He further states that Phrynosoma adapts itself

            to its surroundings, namely, if placed on a substratum of white

            sand it slowly assumes a light coloration irrespective of light or

            heat and if placed on a substratum of cinders it slowly takes on a

            dark coloration. He concludes that the color adaptation depends

            upon stimuli received through the eyes.



            He was able to bring about a pale coloration in various ways,

            such as forcibly opening the mouth or by the application of a weak

            faradic current to the mucous membranes of the mouth or cloaca.

            He believes that this proximal migration of the pigment may be

            brought about in two ways, namely, by nervous impulses which

            stimulate the melanophores through the sympathetic nervous

            system or by secretion of a hormone (adrenin) from the adrenals.

            The impulses are carried from the mouth or cloaca along the spinal

            cord to a center situated between eighth and thirteenth vertebrae

            and thence by sympathetic fibres to the adrenals. The stimulated

            glands secrete adrenin which is taken up by the blood stream and

            acts directly on the melanophores causing a proximal migration

            of the pigment.



            Redfield concludes from the fact that adrenalin produces

            proximal migration of the pigment in Anolis and from the work of

            Carlton, that impulses through the autonomic nervous system

            cause a distal migration of the pigment, that the melanophores of

            Anolis must possess a double innervation from two divisions of the

            autonomic nervous system. That this is possible he shows by

            analogous tissue, namely, the smooth muscle, the latter one "known

            to be innervated by antagonistic fibres belonging to two morpho-

            logically distinct parts of the autonomic nervous system."



            The explanation for emotional manifestations in Phrynosoma,

            Anolis and other animals is readily explained by his conclusions

            regarding the secretion of adrenin.



            When first placed in captivity the brown and green lizards in

            the same cage are about equally divided, but after remaining in

            captivity for a few weeks the greater proportion become brown

            in the daylight and the green produced by the absence of light has

            lost its former brilliance.



            Much has been written about the true chameleon and its adap-

            tation of color to its surroundings. Keller found, after placing speci-

            mens of Chamcsleon vtdgaris in a green house, that in a short space

            of time he was able to find them only after a most careful search,

            in spite of the fact that when found they were often in plain view.

            However, he does not believe that the surrounding color plays any

            role but that other factors, which he did not attempt to explain,

            bring about these changes. Ditmars states that there is no rela-

            tion between the color of Anolis and its siuroundings.



            One must have great temerity to deny such a statement, but I

            have noted adaptations to the surroundings in Anolis which seem

            to be more than accidental. For instance, I have noticed that on

            dark brown fence rails which contained small areas of green lichen,

            some of the lizards resting on them assimie a dark brown color

            with irregular patches of brilliant green. In other words, a mixed

            state is often evident and the effect produced resembles fairly

            closely the surroundings. Almost invariably the lizards seen on

            the tnmks of the palm trees in New Orleans are brown and are

            often detected with great difficulty.



            The table below represents the findings on May i6, 191 7, from

            11.30 A. M. to 1.45 p. M., during which time the temperature was

            2 5.5°C. The environment is stated, as well as the number of

            lizards noted thereon, and the intensity of their color state. G repre-

            sents green and B brown. The sign + + + represents the greatest

            intensity of either green or brown, namely, either emerald green

            or mahogany brown, -f + represents a less intense color but still

            quite marked, while + indicates the least degree of intensity but

            one in which one is able to definitely st^e the color as being either

            green or brown.

            Except the lizards seen on green foliage, the ntunber of green

            animals equals the brown ones. No brown ones were noted on

            green foliage but the observations here recorded are by far too

            limited to permit definite conclusions to be drawn. There was

            some difficulty in deciding whether an animal resting on a brown

            fence rail amid a mass of green foliage should be classed as one

            resting on a fence rail or on green foliage, but it was decided to

            place these with the former.



            One is justified, however, in drawing one conclusion from the

            table, namely, that under approximately the same conditions of

            temperature and light both green and brown lizards may be found

            and, even on sunshiny days with a moderate temperatiu-e, the

            green ones may even outnumber the brown ones. According to

            Parker, brown should be the prevailing color. It does not appear

            that in their natural environment the reason for the greater num-

            ber of green lizards can be accounted for on the ground that these

            animals reacted more strongly to temperature than to light.



            According to Parker and Starratt, the Anolis remains brown

            at io°C. and remains green at 4o°C., regardless of light. One

            would expect then, that at a temperature of 2 5.5°C., if there were

            a greater susceptibility to temperattire, the brown state would

            prevail for at this temperature there is active both the light and

            medium temperature influence.



            Evidently a factor which is of extreme importance in influencing

            the color state is the emotional or nervous condition which can not

            be easily controlled. The effect of the organs of internal secretion

            which are under the control, directly or indirectly, of the nervous

            system probably also influences the color states.



            Ditmars states that the sleeping Anolis is invariably green and

            that the same color is present during anger or fear. He states

            that if a cage containing a nimiber of these lizards be shaken, all

            take on the green state, but after allowing them to rest for a short

            time, most of them assume the brown state. I have found this to

            be true in general. Also, if a brown Anolis is taken out of its cage

            and held in the hand it becomes green in a few minutes. This

            characteristic change occurs quickly even in animals which have

            been kept in captivity for a ntunber of weeks and have apparently

            become tame.



            It is evident that various factors influence color states and the

            problem becomes even more complex when one considers that

            certain areas of the skin may be light colored, as in the case of the

            mid-dorsal stripe, while the rest of the skin may be dark. One

            must admit that the skin is influenced by three factors, tem-

            perature, light and emotional or nervous conditions, induced, no

            doubt, by way of sense organ stimuli. Yet we get opposite effects

            in two areas of the skin of the same animal. One would hardly

            expect light and temperature to have a selective action on the skin.



            Structure of the Skin of Anolis



            The chief object of this paper is to present a review of the his-

            tological structure of the skin of Anolis and to add some observa-

            tions with the hope that the further investigation of the color

            changes may be enhanced and some of the factors governing the

            color states explained. It is not claimed that a knowledge of the

            minute structures and their relations will offer a full explanation

            of these changes, but without suclt* a knowledge, physiological

            experiments must fail to accomplish this end. It is only by keeping

            in mind the structure of the skin that the actual processes involved

            may be surmized and physiological data be applied in actual

            explanation of the problems.



            The skin of Anolis is comparatively thin and loosely attached

            except at the sides and dorsum of the head and tail. On closer

            observation it is seen that it is not smooth but is thickly studded

            with small, closely-packed scales which vary in shape, color, and

            size in different parts of the body. These small scales, designated

            as scutes by Carlton, are smooth and shiny.



            The scales situated along the mid-dorsal line are irregular in

            shape and size with slight tendency toward a hexagonal outline

            (Fig. i). They are well separated and measure 0.29 mm. length-

            wise to the body and 0.305 mm. in the transverse direction. A

            thickened, linear, longitudinal keel may be present in the mid-line

            of the scale. The scales on the dorso-lateral aspect of the body are

            less irregular than those along the mid-dorsal line and none shows

            overlapping. They measure 0.248 mm. x 0.265 rnm- (Fig- 2).

            Those scales on the lateral aspect of the body are almost circular

            in outline and are arranged in two rows, vertical and horizontal,

            the intersection of the two rows making an angle of about 58°,

            and they measure 0.255 rnm. x 0.248 mm. (Fig. 3).



            The scales on the ventral aspect are larger and more closely

            arranged, the caudal edge of each scale overlapping slightly the

            cephalic end of the scale just behind it. The outline of the scale

            is somewhat oval or circular and there is present a homy ridge or

            keel extending down the middle which becomes more prominent

            as the caudal border is approached. The scales of the region

            measure 0.35 mm. x 0.36 mm. (Fig. 4).



            The scales on the tail differ markedly from those previously

            described. They are hexagonal in outline and closely packed and

            overlap each other to a greater extent than those on the ventral

            surface. There is present a median ridge and the surfaces on

            either side slope away from it. These scales measure 0.45 mm.

            X 0.27 mm. (Fig. 5).



            The dorsal aspect of the head is made up of bilaterally symmetrical

            plates of a more or less hexagonal form. Just posterior to the inter-

            section of the mid-dorsal line and the posterior edge of the orbital

            ridge is a marked pineal eye. The scales on the distended throat-

            fan are widely separated and are flattened and somewhat conical

            in shape. Those of the eyelids are so minute as to be barely visible.



            The color of the individual scales is the same as that described

            for the various areas of the body. When a general color state is

            assumed, for instance brown, isolated scales may be white, tur-

            quoise blue, lighter or darker brown than the general hue, or even

            green.



            Some extremely interesting features are noted in scales on the

            various parts of the body when observed under the low power of

            the microscope, by reflected and by transmitted light. The char-

            acteristics exhibited by the scales present points of similarity, but

            also some very marked differences. For these observations bits of

            fresh skin were taken from different parts of the body and mounted

            in glycerin and the appearance of the scales was studied both from

            the external surface and from the internal surface.



            The external siu-face of the lateral scales appears yellow by

            transmitted light. Scattered evenly throughout are somewhat

            indistinct, pale brown, stellate-shaped bodies, the melanophores,

            which average about fifty in number for each scale. The spaces

            between the scales are transparent and contain many branching

            pigment cells (Fig. 6 A). By reflected light these scales appear

            emerald green and the interspaces black (Fig. 6 B). The internal

            surface appears blue by reflected light and the branching melano-

            phores appear distinct and dark brown or black (Fig. 6 C).



            The external surface of the scales of the ventral surface appears

            a pale straw color by transmitted light and contains isolated indis-

            tinct pale brown melanophores of from four to twelve in number.

            The branches of these melanophores become darker near their

            termination (Fig. 7 A). By reflected light the scales appear some-

            what as inverted glass cups containing crushed ice and the melano-

            phores are cobalt blue except at the termination of their branches

            which are brown (Fig. 7 B). The internal surface by transmitted

            light appears a pale straw color and the melanophores are distinct

            and black (Fig. 7 C).



            The scales along the mid-dorsal stripe differ from those just

            described in that, irrespective of other colors, they have a peculiar

            pinkish cast while the melanophores are much fewer in nvunber in

            many scales and lighter in color than those previously described.



            The scales of the throat-fan are pale straw color by reflected

            light and show the blue appearing melanophores. The wide

            spaces between the scales present many bright red linear streaks of

            varying sizes which branch and anastomose. The underlying color

            is pink and of granular appearance. -^By transmitted light the

            melanophores appear brown and more distinct and the spaces

            between the scales take on an orange color. Injections of india ink

            into the circulation would tend to show that the pink color is not

            entirely due to the vascularity of this structure but to some other

            coloring matter present.



            It would appear from the differences noted by reflected and

            transmitted light that the melanophores are separated from the

            surface of the scale by some substance which gives them a bluish

            cast by reflected light and pale brown by transmitted light. That

            they themselves are black is evident by viewing them from the

            internal surface of the scale where they present a sharp clear out-

            line (Fig. 6 A, B and C). In order to explain the green color of the

            scales of the lateral aspect of the body it is necessary to eliminate

            the yellow coloring matter which is noted by transmitted light.

            This may easily be accomplished by subjecting the skin to alcohol

            and ether in which this yellow substance readily dissolves. When

            the scales are now viewed externally by reflected light, they no

            longer have the green appearance, but appear deep blue just as do

            the previously described scales viewed from the internal surface

            by reflected light (Fig. 6 C). The melanophores, however, are

            blue and indistinct, indicating, as was later found, that a semi-

            transparent reflecting layer exists between them and the surface

            and that this layer is evidently not affected by ether or alcohol.



            The explanation for the green color is now quite apparent, for

            blue rays are reflected and these in passing through a clear yellow

            medium present to the eye the green color.



            The semi-transparent reflecting layer lying between the melano-

            phores and the external surface reflects bluish-white light as is

            evident in those scales in which little or no coloring matter exists

            and in which the melanophores are sufficiently separated so as not

            to influence the reflected light to any extent. This is true of the

            scales on the ventral aspect of the body, in individual lateral

            scales, and the white ones often found along the mid-dorsal line.



            Histology



            That the tissue relationship of the skin might be more carefully

            analyzed with the purpose of attempting an explanation for the

            changes of color, a nimiber of lizards in various color states were

            killed and segments of the body fixed in different fluids. It was

            found that segments placed for about six weeks in a fluid consisting

            of 3-5% potassium bichromate loo parts, formalin 4 parts, and

            glacial acetic acid 5 parts, gave the best results. Tissue fixed in

            this fluid maintained the cellular relationship and the osseous

            structures were sufficiently decalcified so that entire sections of

            the body could be made.



            Formalin was found to act too slowly with segments of the body.

            Lizards in the green state became brown during its action. It was

            possible, however, to overcome this difficulty by injecting formalin

            quickly with a hypodermic needle under the green skin, thus

            obtaining almost immediate contact of the fluid with the entire

            internal surface of the skin. This method has a distinct advantage

            in that the animals may be studied on the table for a considerable

            length of time after fixation and the color state carefully recorded.

            Unfortunately, however, after a longer time the green color be-

            comes changed to a slaty gray after the use of formalin, due most

            probably to a change in the yellow coloring matter. Removing

            the skin and washing it in water soon after fixing prevents this

            bleaching and bits of skin may then be held between pieces of hard-

            ened celloidin and sectioned. The solubility of the yellow sub-

            stance forbids imbedding in either celloidin or paraffin. These

            sections should then be mounted in glycerine.



            For examination of the cellular elements, tissues imbedded in

            both celloidin and paraffin were sectioned at 1 5 microns and stained

            with haematoxylin and eosin. Frozen sections treated with gold

            chloride for the purpose of showing the nerve endings have, so far,

            not been successful.



            In order that the histological picture be made as complete as

            possible, the elements of a single lateral scale will be described

            (Figs. 10, II, 12, 13 and 14). Where differences exist in the scales

            of other parts of the skin these will be mentioned. The layers

            comprising the scale will be taken up in their order, beginning

            from without inward.



            Epidermis. — The outermost, transparent layer or epidermis

            may be divided into an outer, horny layer or stratum comeum

            and an inner, stratum germinativum. The epidermis is consider-

            ably thicker near the siunmit of the scale than at the periphery

            where it becomes continuous with the thin epidermis of the space

            between the scales.



            The stratum corneum may usually be divided into two layers,

            an outer one which is separated by an interspace from an inner.

            This outer layer represents that portion which is ready to be cast

            off in moulting (Figs. 8 and 12). The inner layer does not stain

            with eosin, being straw-colored. The squamous cells may show

            clear, non-staining, round bodies, representing the degenerated

            nuclei. The layer undergoes marked keratinization at the apex of

            the scale with the formation of a homogeneous, homy ridge or keel.

            This thickening is more marked in the scales on the ventral aspect

            and those along the mid-dorsal line. Keratinization of the other

            cells of the stratum comeiun, other than in the keel, is not so

            marked and, due to the dehydrating effect of the air, become fairly

            well separated so that their outlines may be distinguished (Fig. 8).



            Briicke has described "interference cells" in the outer layer of

            the stratimi corneum in Chamcsleon vulgaris. These cells, he be-

            lieves, modify the color of the skin by reflected light to a very

            marked extent.



            Keller believes that the outer cells of the outer layer of the

            stratum comeum contain minute closely placed columns arranged

            at right angles to the surface of the cell. He calls this outer layer

            the "Relief Schicht," and the inner surface of this outer layer the

            "Negative Relief Schicht." The latter presents the negative

            picture of the former in that instead of minute columns there are

            toothlike incisions corresponding to the columns of the "Relief

            Schicht." The layer between these two he terms the stratiun

            comeum. He further claims that the outer cells of the inner layer

            of the stratum corneum are similar to those of the outer layer and

            terms them the "Second . Relief Schicht." He believes that

            separation occurs along a line corresponding to the boundary

            between the "Negative Relief Schicht" and the second "Relief

            Schicht" and that when the outer layer is cast off the second

            "Relief Schicht" becomes the first and then a second line of cleavage

            occtus making a second "Relief Schicht" and a "Negative Relief

            Schicht." This cleavage goes on at regular intervals. He found

            that the fine colimm-like structures of the cells were very much

            more pronounced in the foot pads and at the apices of the scales.



            In Anolis the first or outer "Relief Schicht" of Keller is very

            prominent on the under surface of the adhesive pads of the second

            phalanges. The second "Relief Schicht" is also present when the

            outer layer of the stratum comeum is well separated from the

            inner layer, but no "Negative Relief Schicht" was noted. On the

            outer cells of the outer layer of the stratum comeimi of the scales

            of the general body, occasionally minute spicules resembling short

            cilia may be seen in stained preparations but such occurrence

            seemed very rare. In dried scrapings, the outer cells seen on the

            flat contain numerous dots giving them a stippled appearance

            when examined with the high dry or oil immersion lens. These

            probably represent the spicules that Keller has described for the

            chameleon. (See Fig. 9.)



            The stratimi germinativum takes the haematoxylin and eosin

            well. The cells are polygonal with fairly large vesicular nuclei.

            In the scales this layer is from two to three cells thick but in the

            epidermis between the scales it is at miost only two cells thick.

            The basal layer is composed of cuboidal and columnar cells with

            large vesicular nuclei. Their proximal borders, attached to an ill-

            defined basement membrane, are frayed and brush-like (Fig. 8).



            That the epidermis, through phenomena of interference, exerts

            some modifying influence on the color of the skin in Anolis is with-

            out doubt, but that it plays the important role which Briicke

            ascribes to it for the chameleon is doubtful. Keller, in fact, dis-

            agrees with Briicke as to the importance of this layer even in the

            chameleon. The small, transparent spicules in the outer layer

            possibly cause some diffraction of light but this must be slight for

            the underlying cellular outlines are markedly clear vv^hen viewed

            through the epidermis.



            The Oil Droplet Layer. — A considerable amount of confusion

            exists in regard to the layer underlying the epidermis. Keller has

            described a layer in the chameleon which he designates the

            ochrophore layer. He does not believe that it is cellular for the

            elements composing it have no nuclei, but he believes that it is

            made up of bits of cytoplasm cast off from an underlying layer of

            cells which he ternis the leucophore layer. This ochrophore layer

            is found on the dorso-lateral aspect of the body but is almost

            entirely absent on the ventral aspect and entirely so on the foot-

            pads and spaces between the scales. Keller found that the ele-

            ments of the layer were brownish yellow by transmitted light and

            a bluish white by reflected light, had a granular appearance, and

            that they disappeared under the influence of mineral acids. He

            described these elements as more or less spindle shaped and verti-

            cally arranged, the ends in contact with the epidermis being more

            pointed than those of the opposite end. The elements farther

            removed from the epidermis had both ends rounded.



            Pouchet called this layer "Iridocytes" and believed the ele-

            ments to be cells although he could not make out the cellular

            structirre.



            In Anolis, Carlton describes what tie believes to be the ochro-

            phore layer of Keller. He admits that its structure is not similar

            to that found in the chameleon. I do not believe that Carlton

            saw a layer corresponding to that in the chameleon, but that he

            described the leucophore layer which he mistook for the ochrophore

            layer. I will take up my reasons for this asstmiption in the dis-

            cussion of the leucophore layer.



            In sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin, I was unable

            to make out any layer corresponding in either position, structure,

            or color to the ochrophore layer. In certain scales, more often

            those situated along the mid-dorsal line, a clear space or a space

            filled with large clear cells with large vesicular nuclei could be

            noted where the ochrophore layer should lie. Knowing that it was

            possible to dissolve out the yellow coloring matter in the scales

            with alcohol and ether, it did not seem improbable that in the

            preparation of the stained sections practically all trace of this

            layer had been lost.

            For this reason formalin fixed skin was sectioned between

            blocks of celloidin very soon after fixing and then mounted in

            glycerine. In these sections, there is situated just beneath the

            epidermis a thin layer made up of bright yellow droplets of varying

            sizes (Fig. lo). These droplets appear beautifully refractive, do

            not contain any granular material, nor are they arranged like the

            elements in the ochrophore layer of Keller. Some of these drop-

            lets may even be found at times between the basal cells of the

            epidermis where they have probably migrated.



            By transmitted light this layer of droplets appears bright

            yellow (Fig. lo A), while by reflected light it disappears almost

            entirely, in other words it does not reflect light to any marked

            extent (Fig. lo B). In this respect it differs from the ochrophore

            layer of Keller, which its describer found to be bluish white by

            reflected light.



            The sections treated with Scharlach R caused this layer to be-

            come brownish red, indicating that the droplets composing it are

            lipochromes.



            This layer of oil droplets is practically absent on the ventral

            surface of the body and entirely so on the adhesive pads of the

            feet. To what extent it is present along the mid-dorsal stripe, I

            am unwilling to say. That it occurs here in individual lizards to

            the same extent as on the lateral scales is true; but whether it is

            greatly diminished in those lizards showing a white dorsal stripe,

            or whether it is present to the same extent but can be displaced to

            the periphery of the scale by a special mechanism and there does

            not effect the color, it is difficult to say. Keller believes that this

            layer can be removed from the field of action by special cells.



            One may conclude, then, that beneath the epidermis of the

            dorso-lateral scales there is a thin layer made up of transparent

            yellow oil droplets and that this disappears in stained preparations

            due to its solubility in alcohol, ether and clearing oils.



            Zanihophores. — Lying just beneath the epidermis of the lat-

            eral aspect of the body and in the oil droplet layer, are

            cells of varying sizes. The larger cells have a clear, round, un-

            stained cytoplasm in the sections stained with haematoxylin and

            eosin. The nuclei are large and vesicular and the chromatic ele-

            ments stain deeply (Figs, ii and 14). The nimiber of these cells

            varies in the scales of the different parts of the body, being prob-

            ably more numerous along the mid-dorsal stripe. In fresh speci-

            mens it was practically impossible to distinguish them with accu-

            racy. These cells were not described by Carlton, but Keller has

            described similar cells for the chameleon and named them zan-

            thophores, and Pouchet also described similar cells for the chame-

            leon and believed that they contained fat droplets of 2.5 microns.

            He believed these cells to be analogous to the yellow cells of batra-

            chians and that they possessed the power of contractility. Keller

            also believed that they could expand or contract for he found them

            varying markedly in size. Doctor Irving Hardesty suggests that

            these cells secrete or control the accumulation of the oil droplet

            layer described above.



            If Keller and Pouchet be correct in their assumption that these

            large clear cells may expand, one might reason that during this

            state they practically fill the entire space between the epidermis

            and the underlying layer and force the yellow droplet layer towards

            the periphery of the scale so that it no longer influences the color

            states.



            For reasons which will be taken up later, I believe that the

            mechanism is not quite as Keller would have one believe, although

            undoubtedly these cells are more nimierous and almost replace

            the oil droplet layer in the white scales of the mid-dorsal stripe.

            If these large, spherical cells in Anolis are the zanthophores of

            Keller, and they resemble very closely those he figures and de-

            scribes, Carlton is wrong in stating that these cells do not exist

            in Anolis.



            The Leitcophore or Guanophore Layefr— The layer lying just be-

            neath the layer of oil droplets presents very marked differences

            from any of the structures previously described. In vertically

            sectioned scales, stained with haematoxylin and eosin, it is seen

            that this layer is thicker near the center of the scale and then

            gradually thins out until it disappears at the periphery. The layer

            forms then an inverted cup which thins out at the edges and fits

            into the hollow epidermal scale but does not come in immediate

            contact with it because of the intervening oil droplet layer. It is

            present in all the scales of the skin including those of the ventral

            aspect of the body (Figs. 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 17). By reflected

            light it appears as a homogeneous bluish- white band (Fig. 10 B),

            and this appearance is not lost in those sections fixed in the fluid

            mentioned and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Bits of the

            layer may be found isolated in the deeper fibrous layer, recogniz-

            able by the bluish-white color.

            By allowing a minimal amount of light to come through the

            condenser of the microscope, the layer has a most brilliant opales-

            cent appearance. In unstained, freshly fixed formalin sections, by

            transmitted light, it has a pale brownish appearance (Fig. lo A),

            but in stained sections it appears darker and greenish brown (Figs.

            II, 12, 13 and 14).



            Fig. ID, A and B, represents the appearance of an unstained sec-

            tion of the layer by reflected and transmitted light. By reflected

            light this layer appears as a bluish-white cloud which obliterates

            the underlying structures, or at least makes them appear hazy and

            indistinct.



            In both the stained and unstained vertical sections the layer is

            seen to be composed of parallel rows of somewhat irregular blocks,

            their long axes being parallel to the outline of the epidermis.

            These blocks are of varying size and asymmetrical shape, and un-

            doubtedly possess small, deeply staining nuclei. Some sections

            show these nuclei better than others. The vertical section gives

            little idea of their morphology for when seen in tangentially cut

            sections they appear very irregular in outline and possess short

            pseudopodoid processes which may terminate in hooklike expan-

            sions or branches. Every conceivable shape exists and no simi-

            larity exists in these bodies except in their marked irregularity

            (Fig 14). In some sections these cells appear syncytial, for their

            processes are in juxtaposition, thus leaving numerous openings of

            various sizes between these apparently joined processes. Through

            these openings run the branches of the melanophores (Figs. 14

            and 17). That really no syncytium exists appears likely, for in

            vertical sections no such connections between the processes can be

            made out. When viewed from above, the area around the nucleus

            has a bluish cast while the periphery is a pale greenish brown.



            One can conclude then that the cells of this layer are fairly thick,

            irregular plates of fairly uniform thickness throughout but with a

            marked irregular outline.



            Carlton describes a somewhat similar layer in the scale of Anolis

            which he calls the ochrophore layer and which he considers analo-

            gous to the ochrophore layer of Keller for the chameleon. He

            believes that this layer produces the green color and finds that by

            reflected light it appears bluish green and by transmitted light

            yellowish green. From the micro-photographs accompanying his

            paper, one cannot be mistaken as to the identity of the layer in

            question. He has noted the block-like, parallel arrangement in

            the vertical section and also the irregular appearance in the tan-

            gential section, stating that it had the appearance of a more or less

            homogeneous mass, irregular in outline, and penetrated in many

            places by the processes of the melenophores but he was unable to

            make out any cellular structure and denied the existence of nuclei

            except between the blocks. Why he should believe this layer to be

            the ochrophore layer of Keller, I am unable to say. He admits

            that its arrangement differs from Keller's ochrophore layer.



            If Carlton's ochrophore layer is responsible for the green state

            in Anolis, why is this layer present on the ventral aspect of the

            animal where no green color is ever present?



            Keller states that this ochrophore layer is almost entirely

            absent on the ventral aspect of the body of the chameleon, yet

            Carlton, in spite of these differences in structure and position,

            attempts to make these two layers analogous. Furthermore,

            Carlton's ochrophore layer closely fits the description of Keller's

            leucophore layer, which latter Carlton states does not exist in

            Anolis.



            Undoubtedly the layer in Anolis is the same as that in the

            chameleon except for possibly minor differences.



            Briicke described in the chameleon a white or yellow pigment

            which he finds separated into two layers, the inner being thicker

            and made up of closely packed colorless particles with rounded

            boundaries, which reflect light, resulting in the white appearance.

            He believes these reflecting granules^© be the product of cells

            whose processes force themselves between the dermal structures

            and lie between the epidermis and the underlying connective

            tissue. In these two layers he evidently includes both the ochro-

            phore layer and the leucophore layer of Keller.



            Pouchet has also described this layer and considers the white,

            dust-like material as the products of cells which, by the growth of

            the neighboring tissue, have been pressed into plates, and Keller

            describes these plates or blocks which he names leucophores. He

            considers their content similar to that found in the scales of cer-

            tain fish described by Klihne and which are said to be composed

            of guanine. The fact that both react positively to the murexide

            test leads to this assumption. He believes, as does Pouchet, that

            these leucophores have been pressed into plates by the pressure

            of the overlying and underlying tissues and that their edges adapt

            themselves to the neighboring structures due to the mechanical

            resistance of the latter, and, in consequence, assume very irregular

            shapes except in those regions where no such pressure is exerted.

            In regions where no pressiire is exerted, they are rounded and He

            close together in the wide meshes of the connective tissue.



            I was unable to verify Keller's observations that the leucophores

            were rounded in those regions where the mechanical resistance is

            less, for those isolated cells which were noted by me showed in

            reality even greater irregularity, when seen in vertical section,

            than those in the leucophore layer proper. That the peculiar plate

            or block-like shape and the arrangement of these in parallel rows

            may be due to the pressure of the dense connective tissue from

            below seems likely, but only careful observations of the skin in

            various stages of development can determine this point.



            The white, dust-like material of Pouchet, the white pigment of

            Briicke, or the granules of Keller, which were described in the

            leucophores, were not noted by me in Anolis. The cytoplasm of

            these cells even in the fresh state was clear and apparently free

            from granules. This finding is interesting in that one would

            expect the reflecting power of these cells to be due to the denser

            granules, and probably such granules do exist but were invisible

            because of methods I employed in the study of these cells.



            No differences in shape or position were noted in the leucophore

            layer in the green and brown state. The cells of the layer seem

            to retain their characteristic appearance and relationship no mat-

            ter what color state of the skin existed. Carlton makes the same

            observation for his so-called ochrophore layer.



            The blue coloration of the melanophores by reflected light de-

            scribed for the scales of the ventral aspect of the body is undoubt-

            edly due to the leucophore layer as is also the white appearance

            of these scales. This will be touched upon later.



            The Melanophores. — Lying between the leucophore layer and

            the underlying connective tissue layer, and partially imbedded in

            both, are the melanophores described by Keller for the chameleon

            (Figs. 10, II, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17).



            In Anolis three types of pigment cells are found, namely, those

            in the dorso-lateral scales which differ from those in the ventral

            scales by their smaller size and more delicate branching, those in

            the ventral scales, and a third type which is commonly situated

            just beneath the epidermis between the scales. The melanophores

            show a striking resemblance to the Purkinje cells as seen in Golgi

            preparations. A line passing through the cell bodies of the ma-

            jority of them would be more or less parallel to the epidermis except

            at the periphery of the scale where they more closely approach

            the surface. A few cell bodies lie above or below this imaginary

            line, but in thick sections the bodies of the melanophores form a

            fairly thick, dark-brown layer of fairly regular width.



            The melanophores are best studied in vertical sections of the

            fixed material stained with haematoxylin and eosin. It was found

            unnecessary to use the methods adopted by Keller and others to

            bring out the finer branches of these cells, for in most of the prepa-

            rations these were clearly visible.



            The cell body is more or less rounded but considerable difference

            exists among them, some being much narrower than others (Figs.

            II and 12). The surface facing the epidermis is often concave but

            rarely it may be convex or apical. The nucleus may be round,

            oval, reniform, horseshoe-shaped or even double in rare instances.

            In some preparations it takes a fairly deep blue stain and has a

            vesicular appearance (Figs, ii, 15 and 17). The concavity when

            present is directed towards the epidermis.



            Coming off from the sides of the outer surface of the cell body

            are a varying number of permanent branches which run either

            vertically toward the inner surface of the epidermis or present a

            lateral curvature. The curvature may even be so marked that,

            at the proximal part, the branches may be directed first down-

            wards and laterally and then gradually curve laterally and up-

            wards (Figs. II, 12, 13 and 15). These^ranches run through the

            spaces among the leucophores and, as they approach the surface,

            lateral branches in turn give off further branches. This tree-like

            branching continues until beneath the under surface of the epi-

            dermis a layer of fine terminal branches exists.



            The contents of the melanophores consists of a varying amount

            of fine pigment granules imbedded in a mass of faintly brown,

            poorly staining cytoplasm. The arrangement and distribution of

            the pigment granules depends on the color state of the skin, being

            almost absent in the smaller branches in the green state but present

            even in the terminal branches in the brown state. Under the oil

            immersion lens the poorly staining cytoplasm may be followed

            even in the finest branches lying beneath the epidermis. Follow-

            ing them is, however, greatly facilitated by the presence of isolated

            pigment granules which have failed to migrate with the general

            mass of pigment. .



            The pigment granules are oval in shape and brown under

            magnification. Their number varies markedly, irrespective of the

            distribution of the pigment. The number varies not only in

            melanophores in the same scale, but also melanophores of one

            scale may contain more pigment than those of another. Also the

            intensity of the color of the pigment may vary, individual or

            groups of melanophores containing a lighter brown pigment than

            others. This appears to be irrespective of the number of granules.

            These differences in amount and intensity in color are so striking

            that there is no doubt as to their occurrence (Figs. 11,12 and 13).



            In the green state of the skin of Anolis (Figs. 10 and 11) the pig-

            ment granules are present only in the bodies and proximal parts

            of the primar3^ branches of the melanophores. This proximal

            migration of the pigment is practically complete and the finer

            distal branches are clear and transparent. In some of these finer

            branches, however, a few scattered pigment granules may have

            failed to follow the mass of pigment and their presence allows one

            to detect more readily the finer branches. The bodies of the melan-

            ophores during the proximal migration of the pigment are neces-

            sarily darker than after distal migration. In proximal migration

            of the pigment it is noticed in the primary branches of the melano-

            phores that there is an area of gradation between the dense pig-

            ment on one side and the clear part on the other side where the

            pigment is much less dense. In this portion the pigment granules

            apparently arrange themselves in parallel rows (Figs. 11 and 15).

            This parallel arrangement has also been observed by Keller in the

            chameleon.



            In the brown state (Figs. 12 and 13) the finest branches lying

            immediately beneath the epidermis are filled with closely packed

            pigment. This gives the appearance of a thin, dark-brown layer

            lying just beneath the epidermis in vertical section. One might

            conclude that, in order that this appearance can be produced, the

            terminal branches must anastom.ose and fonn a plexus. That this

            is not the case, however, may be readily determined in tangentially

            cut sections where the terminal branches appear as separated but

            closely packed, dark-brown dots (Fig. 14). Keller makes this

            observation for the chameleon and Carlton for Anolis.



            It is probable that the green state of Anolis does not represent

            the maximimi degree of proximal migration of the pigment. In

            certain scales, pigment may be absent even in the primary branches

            and be confined entirely to the cell body which appears like a dark

            brown or black sphere. Furthemiore the pigment may be con-

            densed to such a degree that a clear broad halo of cytoplasm may

            surround a central compacted mass of pigment (Fig. 15 A and B).

            These peculiar melanophores are often bilaterally arranged and

            present in a group of from two to three scales on each side of the

            body. This bilateral arrangement appears too marked to be acci-

            dental. Melanophores in this condition must explain the yellow-

            colors and white scales often to be observed in the living Anolis.



            Besides the distal and proximal migration of the pigment, any

            degree of migration may be present, namely, all but the terminal

            branches may be filled with pigment, or the terminal branches may

            contain scattered pigment, and so on. All of these conditions in-

            fluence the color state of the skin and must be associated with

            definite color states.



            The number of melanophores varies considerably in the various

            scales, but the average for those of the lateral aspect of the body

            is about fifty in number. This number is greatly reduced in the

            scales along the mid-dorsal line which are white and in which ten

            to fifteen pale brown melanophores appear to be the usual number.

            The latter are slightly smaller and their branches are more delicate

            and spread out more than the others. In the mid-dorsal line of

            other specimens where no white stripe exists but where color

            changes resemble those of the lateral aspect of the body, the me-

            lanophores cannot be distinguished from the others and appear in

            about the same number.



            The melanophores in the scales, on^the ventral aspect of the

            body are from five to twelve in nimiber. Their bodies are larger

            and more rounded and possess fewer primary branches. The

            terminal branches are followed with greater difficulty to the

            periphery. The pigment is usually thickly packed in the cell

            bodies giving the cells a dark-brown color. The nucleus due to

            this increased amount of pigment is rarely observed (Fig. 8).



            The pigment cells lying in the spaces between the scales vary

            markedly in number and position and, aside from their possession

            of branches and pigment content, show little resemblance to the

            true melanophores (Figs. 11, 12, 13 and 16). They more nearly

            resemble ordinary mesenchymal pigment corpuscles. The body

            resembles a flattened disc as is readily seen by comparing the verti-

            cal diameter as seen in vertical section (Fig. 13) with the horizontal

            diameter as seen from above (Fig. 16). The primary branches are

            thick and irregular and vary considerably in length. The terminal

            branches are short and terminate broadly in club-like ends. The

            cells are present just beneath the epidermis between the scales,

            their branches spreading out and lying parallel to it. These cells

            may often be found in the deeper tissues of the body and give the

            impression of their being able to wander between the tissues

            (Fig. 13). That these cells may be converted into melanophores

            seems possible.



            That the pigment granules migrate in the fixed pseudopodic

            processes of the melanophores, instead of an amoeboid extension

            of and retraction of the processes themselves, is very probable.

            This migration has been clearly illustrated by Keller and Briicke

            for the chameleon, Carlton for Anolis, Degner ior Praunus flexuosus ,

            Kahn and Lieben for Rana temporaria and Spaeth for Fundulus

            heteroclitus . Parker believes that the pigment migration is true

            for Phymosoma and, further, states that the migration of pigment

            in melanophores is influenced by light and temperature, either

            light or low temperature causing a distal migration and absence

            of light or high temperature causing a proximal migration.



            Although fully agreeing that the melanophores and their

            processes remain fixed and that their pigment undergoes migration,

            I am unable to see how any set of factors influence all melano-

            phores similarly. Under precisely similar conditions the melano-

            phores of the lateral aspect of the body may contain proximally

            migrated pigment, whereas the melanophores of the mid-dorsal

            stripe or melanophores of isolated scales may have the pigment

            in the terminal branches. In a single animal, in any color state,

            many exceptions may be found to the rule laid down by Parker.



            Gold chloride preparations repeatedly fail to reveal any nerve

            endings terminating on the bodies of the melanophores but that

            these exist seems most probable. Pouchet described a smaller

            pigment-bearing cell which he termed the erythrophore and which

            closely resembled the melanophore except that it contained a

            purplish-red pigment. Briicke overlooked these cells of Pouchet,

            but according to Keller, the cells only occur on the lateral scales of

            the chameleon in any great number and are not present in all indi-

            viduals. Keller described gradation forms, cells containing both

            brown and red granules in different proportions. Some cells may

            contain only a few red granules among brown ones while others may

            contain only a few brown ones, the greater proportion being red.



            Carlton was unable to find erythrophores in the skin of Anolis

            and denied their existence. I believe that Carlton is correct, for

            if these cells be present they must be extremely rare. No red pig-

            ment granules were observed in any melanophores of my sections.

            It seems likely, however, that the pigment granules vary consid-

            erably in the intensity of their color as has already been stated.

            This conclusion is reached not only from a study of the pigment

            granules in the melanophores but also from their effect on the

            color of the skin. There is little doubt that a condensed mass of

            pigment will produce a darker brown than more scattered pigment,

            but the former will always be brown and can never be black or

            brick-red.



            If this be true, then the melanophores producing the post-

            orbital black patch must contain black pigment granules and

            those producing the brick-red stripe must contain reddish-brown

            granules. Furthermore, it is possible that an individual scale may

            contain melanophores of two or more kinds of pigment content

            and that these may act independently of one another. This is

            suggested by the microscopic appearance as well as the appearance

            of either a brick-red, brown, or black state in the scales of the mid-

            dorsal and the post-orbital stripes. Undoubtedly the amount of

            pigment present plays an important role, but many of these differ-

            ences cannot be satisfactorily explained. Partial distal migration

            may be responsible for a lighter brown color than maximal distal

            migration, but only up to a certain point. Any distal migration

            beyond this is not associated with a still lighter brown state but

            with a slaty or greenish-gray color.



            The Connective Tissue Layer. — Lyijjg beneath the leucophore

            layer, running into the concavity of the scale for a variable distance

            but approaching more closely the epidermis at the edges of the

            scale, is a fairly dense layer of white, fibrous connective tissue

            (Figs. 8, lo, II, 12 and 13). The fibres appear to run parallel but

            on closer inspection many vertical and oblique ones may be noted.

            The vertical fibres may be traced as they ascend among the cells

            of the leucophore layer where they break up into small fibril

            bundles which form a network beneath the epidermis. This layer

            takes on a bright pink color with eosin and contains many deeply

            staining stellate and spindle shaped nuclei. It is fairly vascular

            and nerves may be seen traversing it. Below the concavity of the

            scale are present fat corpuscles and large blood vessels (Figs. 11,

            12 and 13). Beneath the dense connective tissue separating the

            skin from the underlying skeletal muscles, there is present a loose

            areolar connective tissue. Fine free pigment granules forming a

            fine line between the denser connective tissue and the looser

            areolar tissue, may be seen in many sections. Free granules of red

            color aid in giving the red color to the extended throat-fan.



            The skin is extremely vascular but more so in some regions than

            in others. Larger vessels run beneath the denser connective

            tissue layer and run parallel with it, dipping into the scale. From

            these vessels branches are given off which run through the denser

            connective tissue and also through the leucophore layer to

            directly supply the epidermis (Fig. 13). It seems not improbable

            that a vaso-dilatation occurring under and in the leucophore

            layer, may exert a modifying influence on the color states. The

            pink color of the mid-dorsal stripe may be explained by the effect

            of a vaso-dilatation on a white stripe, and the red appearance of the

            throat-fan is no doubt in part due to blood, as well as to granules

            of red pigment in the subcutaneous connective tissue, which shows

            through the spaces between the scales.



            On the Mechanism of the Color Changes



            The essential structures present for the production of the

            various color states are the epidermis, the yellow oil droplet layer,

            the leucophore layer, the melanophores, and, possibly, the zantho-

            phores and the cutaneous blood supply.



            The skin of the scale is made up of four superimposed, inverted,

            hollow, cup-like layers, the outer being the epidermis. Next to

            this is the oil droplet layer, then the leucophore layer, and lastly,

            the connective tissue layer which, however, supports the integrity

            of the whole.



            The first and last named layers are continuous with those of the

            neighboring scales, but the second and third are limited to the

            scale.



            The epidermis is a transparent layer which acts largely as a

            protecting and supporting structure and, through interference

            phenomena, acts slightly, if at all, as a factor in the color states.



            The second or yellow oil droplet layer presents a thin trans-

            parent yellow mediimi which is extremely important in the pro-

            duction of many of the color states. In and superficial to it lie

            the fine terminals of the branches of the melanophores. The large

            zanthophores also lie in it and extend inward into the next layer.

            The oil droplets give a strong, bright color by transmitted light,

            but seem to reflect but little light (Fig. 10 A and B). It seems to

            act more as a filter than as a reflector. White light reflected from

            the underlying layer, when passing through this yellow medium,

            must be so acted upon as to give the yellow.



            The leucophore layer, lying just internal to the oil droplet layer,

            acts essentially as a reflecting layer. It reflects a large proportion

            of the light which falls upon it, but it also screens the light to a

            great extent from the underhv'ing brown melanophores so that

            pigment granules, when only in the bodies of the melanophores,

            exert but little influence on the color states of the skin. On the

            other hand, however, if the primary branches of the melanophores,

            which pierce this layer, are filled with pigmient, the light which

            falls on it is reflected as blue light (Fig. loB). Further, cell

            bodies of the melanophores, lying internal to the leucophore layer,

            appear blue by reflected light in the scales of the ventral surface

            of the body in which the yellow oil droplet layer is very scant and

            in places absent (Fig. 7 B). Evidently then, the leucophore layer

            in part reflects all the rays of white light and also absorbs all but

            the blue raj'S from the light passing through it and reflected from

            the brown pigment within and internal to it. Traversing this

            leucophore layer are the large branches of the melanophores, con-

            nective tissue, and finer blood vessels. Partly imbedded in the

            lower stratum and beneath it are the melanophores. Fig. 17 is an

            attempt to show in perspective the various layers and their relation

            to one another.



            The only layer that remains fixed and present in all scales and

            not subject to variations is the leucophore layer. All the other

            elements may be either absent, increased, decreased, or subject to

            marked variations. All of these other elements function in con-

            junction with the leucophore layer and either by allowing it to

            be unobscured, partially obscured, or by entirely shutting it off

            from the light, produce the color phenomena. The appearance of

            white and pale blue, as found on the ventral aspect of the body or

            along the mid-dorsal stripe, may be explained as due to the oil

            droplet layer being either absent or that it has been forced to the

            edges of the scale. A purely white scale must mean that the mel-

            anophores are either absent or greatly diminished in nxunber, and

            very pale blue scales, that their pigment granules must have

            migrated entirely into the bodies of the cells. This allows the

            leucophore layer to act alone as a reflecting layer without the in-

            fluence of any other element. In addition, the stratum corneimi

            of the scales of the ventral surface is slightly thicker than in other

            keel of the scale found here, no doubt results in more light being

            reflected from the outer surface of the scale and thus a whiter

            appearance. It seems probable that by a vaso-dilatation of the

            superficial capillaries a pink color may be imparted to the white

            scales. Further, in addition to the blood capillaries, red pigment

            is manifestly present in the subcutaneous connective tissue of the

            throat-fan.



            If, in the white scales, melanophores are present and send out

            pigment into the primary and larger branches, the light, which is

            now acted upon by the leucophore layer, is returned as blue.

            Decidedly blue scales are rare except in isolated scales on the

            lateral aspect of the body. Along the mid-dorsal stripe and on

            the ventral aspect, melanophores are too few in number to influence

            the color beyond a pale blue. I injected brown pigment (potassium

            bichromate solution) into the skin of the belly, and a blue color was

            readily produced. Higgins' brown ink furnishes the same result

            in the same way.



            The yellow or orange appearance may be readily explained by

            the presence of the yellow oil droplet layer through which light

            from the leucophore layer must be transmitted. The melano-

            phores, in the case of the yellow skin, must contain the pigment

            in their bodies, and the branches must be free of pigment. The

            degree of yellow color depends on the amount of oil droplets, the

            straw-yellow color being associated with a lesser amount than

            the deep yellow. Pale yellow is often present on the ventral

            aspect of some lizards due to the presence of a small amount of

            this substance.



            The emerald green is brought about by the migration of pig-

            ment into the primary and larger branches of the melanophores.

            Now the light which is reflected from the leucophore layer, due to

            the presence of pigment granules, is blue, and this blue, in pass-

            ing through the yellow oil droplet layer, mixes with yellow rays

            given by this layer and appears at the surface as green. By

            further distal migration of the pigment granules, light from the

            leucophore layer assumes a deeper blue which in turn produces

            the bluish-green color of the skin.



            By a still more distal migration of the pigment a muddy,

            greenish gray appears which, as the migration proceeds, becomes

            brownish gray, then light brown and, lastly, a deep mahogany

            brown is produced, which indicates that distal migration has pro-

            ceeded till the granules have accumulated immediately beneath

            the epidermis sufficiently to block the action of both the yellow-

            oil droplets and the leucophore layer. The pigment granules now

            act entirely alone and produce the brown state (Figs. 12 and 13).



            Whether the yellow oil droplet layer can be dispersed under

            varying stimuli in those scales where it normally exists, that is,

            whether it is possible for a lateral green scale to assume the white

            or bluish state in a short space of time, is difficult to say. If, as is

            held by Keller for the chameleon, the zanthophores possess the

            power of dilating and can take up all the space held previously

            by the oil droplet layer and thus displace the latter to the edges of

            the scale, it would at least be possible for a fairly rapid change to

            occtir from green to white. Pouchet, however, believes the zan-

            thophores of the chameleon to be of yellow color and if this be so,

            Keller's explanation would not be valid. The zanthophores of

            Anolis appear transparent in all the conditions under which I could

            observe them. They seem to be absent in the skin of the ventral

            surface of the body. However, my observations are by far too

            meager for me to draw any definite conclusions. It is true that

            the zanthophores seem greatly increased in the white scales of the

            mid-dorsal stripe and that they form a transparent fairly thick

            layer between the epidermis and the leucophore layer.



            The objections to Keller's views are that if the zanthophores

            are able to disperse the oil droplet layer by dilating, they would

            probably also disturb the arrangement of the terminal branches

            of the melanophores, which we know'Soes not take place. One

            would also conclude that these cells must be under the control of

            the nervous system. No conclusions can be reached without

            observing the living animals for long periods of time and noting

            the changes of these white areas. Possibly the white areas are

            merely variations and are more or less permanent. Black or brick-

            red stripes may be also variations in the distally migrated pigment.



            The following table presents in a concise manner the mechanism

            involved in the various color states. Keller's theory in regard to

            the behavior of the zanthophores is included as a possibility,

            since their attributed function becomes necessary to explain

            white and blue changes in certain cutaneous areas, if these occur

            with any degree of rapidity.

            observations over long periods of time of the habits and color

            states of these lizards in their natural environment. The first

            method of attack is always open to criticism so long as the experi-

            ments are not carefully controlled; for instance in none of the

            experiments performed by either Parker and Starratt or Carlton

            were the factors of varying external stimuli taken into con-

            sideration.



            Lizards kept for long periods in confinement may give one set

            of results but one is not justified in drawing any general con-

            clusions as to the behavior of all lizards.



            I wish to thank Doctor Hardesty and Doctor Garey for their

            helpful suggestions.



            Summary



            1. In its color changes, Anolis carolinensis shows a greater

            variety of colors than has been usually described for this animal.

            It may at times take on other colors than the emerald green,

            mahogany brown, and the variations intermediate between these.

            The variations, though apparently less frequent, correspond

            fairly 'closely with the variations described for Chamceleon vulgaris.



            2. The color changes, in addition to general variations in Anolis

            carolinensis, as observed in its natural environment especially,

            seem to be induced by variations in external stimuli. Rhythmic

            changes of color may be observed with the animal in the same

            position with unchanged temperature ^d light, and emotional

            states interpreted as fear, sexual excitement, and anger (prelim-

            inary to and during combat) seem to more actively bring

            about color changes than temperature and light. Color changes

            in sympathy with environment (protective coloration) seem

            probable.



            3. In structure, the skin of Anolis resembles that described

            by other investigators for Chamosleon vulgaris, except no "Negative

            Relief Schicht" could be distinguished in the stratum corneum of

            the epidermis, and no cells corresponding exactly to the eryth-

            rophores of Pouch et could be determined. Also the oil droplet

            layer described here for Anolis is not the same as the ochrophore

            layer described by Keller for Chameleon.



            4. The observations of Carlton that the processes of the mel-

            anophores in Anolis are fixed or non-amceboid and that migration

            of the pigment granules occurs within them, is hereby confirmed.

            In this the nielanophores are similar to those described for

            Chairiceleon, Fundulus heierocUius , Rana temporaria, and other

            color-changing animals.



            5. The color changes in Anolis depend upon the reciprocal

            physical action of four layers of the skin: the epidermis, the

            yellow oil droplet layer, the leucophore layer and the melano-

            phores. The physical characters making possible light inter-

            ference and absorption, and the mixing of transmitted and

            reflected rays, modified by the migration of pigment to different

            positions in these layers, result in the varieties of color apparent

            at the surface of the skin at different times and on different locali-

            ties of the body. The red coloration of the throat-fan is due to a

            rich capillary plexus and to the presence of a red coloring matter

            in the deeper layers. The effect of vaso-dilatation is also apparent

            in the pinlc stripe noted occasionally along the mid-dorsal line.



            6. The oil droplet layer and the leucophore layer in general

            remain fixed and the various color states depend on the migration

            of the pigment granules in the fixed processes of the melanophores.

            Maximal proximal migration of the pigment is associated with

            yellow, while maximal distal migration produces dark mahogany

            brown. In the emerald green state the pigment lies in the primary

            and larger branches of the melanophores. Further distal migration

            is associated with bluish-green or slaty-gray color states depend-

            ing on the degree.

            (st. germ.), the leucophore layer (leuc), a single melanophore

            (melan.), and the connective tissue (conn. tiss.).



            Plate 7, Fig. 9

            Scraping of the stratimi comeum under oil immersion showing

            a group of squamous cells with their stippled appearance.



            Plate 9, Fig. id (High Dry Power)

            (A). Vertical section of a lateral scale in the green state by

            transmitted light, freshly hardened with twenty per cent formalin

            and unstained. This shows the transparent epidermis, the under-

            lying layer of yellow oil droplets (0), the layer of leucophores (L),

            the melanophores with their numerous branches (M), and the

            underlying layer of connective tissue (C).



            (B). The same by reflected light showing the bluish-white

            leucophore layer (L) and the black melanophores (M). The

            latter appear blue when lying beneath the former. The yellow oil

            droplet layer scarcely reflects any light.

            Vol. X] VON GELDERN—SKIN OF ANOLIS CAROLINENSIS 117



            Plate 9, Fig. ii (Oil immersion)



            Vertical section of a lateral scale in the green state, stained

            with haemotoxylin and eosin showing the various layers of the

            epidermis and corium. Small amounts of pigment appear in the

            terminal branches of the melanophores but the mass appears in

            the cell bodies.



            Plate 9, Fig. 12 (Oil immersion)



            Vertical section of a lateral scale in the brown state stained

            with haemotoxyhn and eosin showing the pigment lying just

            beneath the epidermis.



            Plate 9, Fig. 13 (Oil immersion)

            Vertical section of a dorso-lateral scale in the brown state

            stained with haemotoxylin and eosin showing the pigment cells (P)

            and a blood vessel, lying just beneath the connective tissue layer,

            sending a branch through all the layers and which ends just

            beneath the epidermis. The leucocytes are evident.



            Plate 9, Fig. 14 (Oil immersion)

            Tangential section of a lateral scale in the brown state showing

            the pigment in the terminal branches of the melanophores (T),

            the pigment just beneath the epidermis (E), the leucophores with

            their bizarre outlines (L), the secondary branches of the melano-

            phores piercing the openings between the melanophores (S), and

            the bodies of the melanophores with their primary branches (M).



            Plate 8, Fig. 15 (Oil immersion)



            (A). Melanophores occasionally found showing a central migra-

            tion of the pigment in the body of the cell, forming a rounded mass

            surrounded by a halo of clear cytoplasm.



            (B). Melanophores frequently found showing an ahnost com-

            plete proximal migration of the pigment. Practically no pigment

            exists even in the primary branches. The nuclei are evident.



            Plate 9, Fig. 16 (Oil immersion)

            Pigment cell seen from above. These cells are found in the

            spaces between the scale and throughout the entire body. In

            vertical section these cells appear flat.



            Plate 7, Fig. 17

            Reconstruction of the skin of Anolis carolinensis showing the

            essential elements necessary for the production of the color states,

            namely, the epidermis, yellow oil droplet layer, zanthophores,

            leucophores, and melanophores.

            Ground has not yet been broken for the Steinhart

            Aquarium. This is not due to any lack of desire on the part

            of the Council and the Trustees to further its early con-

            struction. The trust which the Academy has accepted will

            be faithfully discharged. More than a year ago the bequest

            became available and the sum of $250,000 was paid to the

            Academy. This sum was at once invested and interest has

            been accumulating. Dr. Evermann, accompanied by Civil

            Engineer T. Ronneberg, has made an inspection trip to all the

            notable aquariums in the United States in order that the

            Academy may have the advantage of the latest and best ideas

            on general arrangement, lighting and operation. The archi-

            tect, Mr. Lewis P. Hobart, thereupon made a number of pre-

            liminary studies from which it presently became apparent that

            the funds at our disposal were not adequate to provide a

            building of the size, dignity and architectural finish which

            would be required if the aquarium is given the place of

            honor in the Academy's building scheme. It was found im-

            practicable, in other words, to put the aquarium to the East

            of the unit in which our present exhibits and activities are

            housed, where it could be made, if funds permitted, an im-

            posing central feature at the rear of an aquatic court. When

            this fact became apparent the architect did the next best thing.

            He so arranged a design that only a small portion of the ex-

            terior of the building would require finishing in stone. But

            even with this arrangement under which only a narrow front

            of the building would be architecturally ornamental, there has

            been difiiculty in finding a site at once appropriate and ac-

            ceptable to the Board of Park Commissioners. The matter

            of selecting a site and of suggesting a building suited to the

            site is now in the hands of a joint committee of the Park

            Commission and of the Academy.



            It is regrettable that the funds placed by bequest at the

            disposal of the Academy are limited to an amount which will

            not srive to San Francisco all that is desired in connection

            with a first class, fully equipped aquarium in which the ma-

            rine life of the Pacific Ocean and the aquatic life of the

            streams which flow into the Pacific Ocean should be ade-

            quately represented. Even with extreme restriction of the

            exterior ornamentation of the aquarium building it will not

            be possible to provide more than about 50 tanks of moderate

            size. There will be no space provided in accomplishing this

            result for fishery and display exhibits, for research work, or

            for offices. The bare housing of the fish tanks, and of the

            machinery and appliances required to store, filter, aerate and

            cool or heat the water, is all that can be accomplished with

            the means at command.

            Vol. X] GRUNSKY— PRESIDENT'S REPORT FOR 1920 125



            Some thought has been given to combining with the

            aquarium an auditorium or otherwise bringing under the

            same roof space that may be used for other purposes, with-

            out in any sense detracting from the distinctiveness of the

            Steinhart Aquarium. Nothing along this Hne seems possible

            of accomphshment. The aquarium once estabhshed will al-

            ways be the "Steinhart Aquarium." Enlargement or exten-

            sion by other bequests or endowments is not likely so long

            as the features added by such bequests or endowments are

            not sufficiently distinctive to perpetuate the names of those

            whose generosity prompts their making. Nor does it seem

            likely that the City, which is the beneficiary, could be pre-

            vailed on in the near future to increase the initial fund.

            Nevertheless, before it is too late, this thought is thrown out.

            It would indeed be a gracious thing if the City which has

            authorized the Academy to accept the bequest and to take

            charge of the erection and operation of an aquarium in

            Golden Gate Park, would add a like amount. It would

            thereby make possible the erection of a dignified structure

            adequate for immediate needs and arranged for expansion to

            meet any future requirements.



            The financial standing of the Academy will appear from

            the Treasurer's report. The endeavor of the Council and of

            the Trustees has been to do the utijaost that could be done

            within our resources as well in the matter of adding to

            the material in the Academy's collections as in research work

            and the publication of results. What has been done along

            these lines will appear more fully from the report of Dr.

            Evermann, the Director of the Museum, and the reports of

            the curators of the various departments.



            As you were advised a year ago our floating debt which

            had been incurred during the erection of the Museum build-

            ing, had been wiped out in 1919. This year we note with

            satisfaction that our indebtedness on the Academy's Market

            Street property has been reduced by $10,000, from $300,000

            to $290,000.



            For a grizzly bear habitat group, as was noted in the

            President's last annual report, funds have been provided by

            Mr. Ogden Mills and the necessary specimens for the group

            have now been secured from the Yellowstone Park without

            expense to the Academy, by Dr. Saxton Pope, assisted by

            Arthur Young and G. D. Pope. Permission was granted

            by the Park authorities to get four grizzly bear for this pur-

            pose. It is expected that before the close of this calendar

            year the group will be installed. It will fill the last available

            alcove and, thereafter, the need for more exhibit space will be

            felt more than ever.



            The Academy is a growing institution, as yet but inade-

            quately equipped to carry on the activities which should be its

            special concern. It should have more housing facilities for

            scientific and educational natural history material. It should

            be engaged in carrying natural history lessons into the school

            rooms of the city and it should have better facilities for popu-

            lar lectures on scientific subjects. Despite the present inade-

            quate facilities the weekly lectures (Sunday afternoons) have

            proved very successful. Their scope appears from the list

            submitted. They are attended to the limit of our small audi-

            torium's seating capacity. I am sure that I voice the senti-

            ments of all members and friends of the Academy who have

            attended any of these lectures, when I say that the kindness

            of those who have given the lectures, frequently at no little

            personal inconvenience, has been sincerely appreciated.



            In the President's last annual report note was made of the

            fact that on appeal to the Supreme Court, the will of Mr. S.

            F. Thorn under which the Academy was bequeathed some

            land near Santa Cruz and other property, had been sustained.

            It was subsequently learned that this decision was not rend-

            ered by the Court in banc. Upon further hearing, the Court

            in banc reversed the earlier decision, finding that the will was

            not holographic because the single word ''Cragthorn" had

            been inserted with a rubber stamp. The will was declared

            illegal and it now appears that the announcement of last year

            was at fault and that the Academy takes nothing under the

            will.



            Among the notable acquisitions of the Academy during the

            year is the W. Otto Emerson collection of bird skins, some

            5300 in number. Most of the birds represented in this col-

            lection, which has great scientific value, are from Alameda

            County. It has come to us through the generosity of W. H.

            Crocker and John W. Mailliard.

            Private subscriptions by a number of friends of the

            Academy have made possible the purchase of the Albert

            Prager Herbarium, which contains many valuable plant speci-

            mens from various parts of the globe. Negotiations for the

            transfer of this herbarium from Leipzig, Germany, the home

            of Mr. Prager, to the Museum of the Academy, have been

            completed.



            Your officers again commend the zeal and ability with

            which the curators of the Academy's departments have con-

            ducted their work, which goes so far in maintaining the

            standing of the Academy as a scientific institution of real

            worth. Your officers are appreciative too of the interest

            taken by the membership in the activities of the Academy,

            and are gratified to note how popular the museum has be-

            come as evidenced by the large number of visitors reported

            by the Director of the Museum.



            The Academy stands ready to enlarge its usefulness. It

            can do so materially, however, only through outside help.

            As opportunity offers this fact should be made known to

            those who are so circumstanced that they can serve mankind

            by establishing endowments for useful purposes. They should

            know that the Academy is ready to serve.

            REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE MUSEUM FOR



            THE YEAR 1920



            BY



            BARTON WARREN EVERMANN

            Director of the Mtiseum



            The annual report of the Director for the year 1919 was

            presented to the Academy at the annual meeting February

            18, 1920. At that time all except one of the spaces for large

            habitat groups in the mammal and bird halls had been filled.

            The one remaining space has been reserved for a Grizzly

            Bear Group. The grizzly bear is now extinct in California.

            None of us will ever see a living example of that magnificent

            animal which figured so prominently in the early history of

            the State; it is said there is no really good specimen of the

            species in any museum in the world. It has therefore been

            decided to put in a habitat group of a closely related species

            (Ursus imperator) which occurs in the Yellowstone Park,

            Dr. Saxton Pope (a member of the Academy) of San Fran-

            cisco, offered to secure the necessary animals, without ex-

            pense to the Academy, if the necessary permit were secured.

            Application was made to the National Park Service for a

            permit for Dr. Pope to kill the necessary animals, the pemiit

            was obtained, and Dr. Pope secured the animals. The taxi-

            dermists have begun the preparation of the group which, it is

            believed, will be completed by September, 1921.



            When Mr. Ogden Mills visited the Museum recently he

            was so pleased with what the Academy has already accom-

            plished in habitat group installation that he generously gave

            his check to the Academy for $5000 to cover the cost of the

            proposed Grizzly Bear Group. It is very gratifying to know

            that this Museum is so appreciated and the Academy feels

            grateful to Mr. Mills for this expression of his appreciation.



            Small Habitat Groups. — With the completion of the Grizzly

            Bear Group all the available spaces for large groups will have

            been utilized. There will remain only spaces for 24 small panel

            groups — five in the bird hall and 19 in the mammal hall. It

            is hoped that all tliese may be completed within the next few

            years.



            PERSONNEL



            Only a few changes have taken place in the personnel of

            the Museum within the year. Mr. William Heim, who was

            employed as taxidemiist, took indefinite leave August 16,

            1920, on account of ill health. It is hoped he may be able

            to return at an early date. Mr. Francis G. Gilchrist, who

            was employed May 10, 1920, as assistant in the department

            of Ornithology and Mammalogy, resigned July 30 to re-enter

            the University of California. Harvey R. Scott was employed

            as assistant taxidennist from July 28 to August 20. Chase

            Littlejohn has been employed as assistant curator, department

            of Ornithology and Mammalogy, since September 13.

            ACCESSIONS TO THE MUSEUM AND LIBRARY



            Accessions to the Museum and the Library have been un-

            VISITORS TO THE MUSEUM



            In accordance with established policy, the Museum was



            open to the public every day in the year. The attendance by

            months for each of the years since the Museum was first

            opened to the public is shown in the following table:

            A comparison of the number of visitors to the Museum of

            the California Academy of Sciences with those who visited

            the Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum at

            Washington in the year ending June 30, 1920, will prove

            very interesting. The visitors by months are given in the

            following table, which shows that the number visiting the

            Smithsonian Institution was only 21 per cent of those visiting

            the Academy Museum; the number visiting the Natural His-

            tory Building of the National Museum was only 4.7 per cent,

            greater than that at the Academy, while that at the Arts and

            Industries Building of the National Museum was only 62

            per cent of that at the Academy, These figures should be

            very gratifying to us.



            1 Attendance from September 22 to 30.

            COOPERATION WITH SCHOOLS



            The Museum continues to cooperate with the pubhc and

            private schools. Teachers and school officials are coming

            to realize more and more clearly that the Museum can be of

            real service to the schools. The number of schools visiting

            the Museum increases each year. During the year 1920 there

            were schools from San Francisco, Berkeley, Oakland, Ala-

            meda, Piedmont and Richmond, and classes from San Jose,

            San Rafael, San Anselmo, San Mateo, and Stockton. When-

            ever possible, the Director or some one of the Museum stafif

            accompanies the school through the Museum and explains

            briefly the general features of the installations, calling at-

            THE PAN-PACIFIC SCIENTIFIC CONGRESS



            Under the auspices of the Pan-Pacific Union, the First

            Pan-Pacific Scientific Congress met at Honolulu x\ugust 2

            to 21. The Director of the Museum attended the Congress,

            as a member of the Pacific Explorations Committee of the

            National Research Council and representing also the Califor-

            nia Academy of Sciences and the Pacific Division of the

            American Association for the Advancement of Science. He

            sailed from San Francisco July 28 and returned September

            8. August 3 to September 1 were spent attending the ses-

            sions of the Congress and visiting places of interest on the

            islands of Oahu and Hawaii.



            The number of delegates and others in attendance upon

            the sessions of the Congress was more than 100. There were

            present delegates from New Zealand, Australia, the Philip-

            pines, China, Japan, Canada, England, and the United States,

            many of those from the United States representing various

            scientific bureaus of the Government.



            The papers and discussions at the sessions of the Congress

            covered many phases of the geology, meteorology, and natural

            history of the Pacific and its contained islands, and it was

            clearly shown that much of importance remains to be learned

            regarding the hydrography, geology, and natural history of

            the Pacific.



            At the close of the Congress the unanimous verdict was

            that the meeting had been a decided success, and that other

            meetings should be held every two or three years,



            FIELD WORK OF THE MUSEUM STAFF

            in the various departments of science, is in almost daily use

            by students. This has been especially true of geologists and

            paleontologists, who are interested in oil investigations and

            prospecting. The large research collections in the different

            departments have been consulted by a number of investigators.

            Mr. L. M. Looniis continues to avail himself of the Acad-

            emy's collections and Library in his study of sea birds.

            Messrs. Joseph Grinnell, Harry S. Swarth, Tracy I. Storer, and

            J. Eugene Law, of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, have

            had occasion to consult our collections of birds, mammals

            and reptiles. Numerous entomologists of the west coast make

            frequent use of the rapidly growing collections in that de-

            partment, and the botanists of the coast find it to their in-

            terest to consult the herbarium.



            The Boy Scouts, under Scout Master Harold E. Hanson,

            have continued the Friday night meetings at the Museum

            throughout the year. The Academy is glad to cooperate in

            this way.

            DEPARTMENT REPORTS



            The curators and their assistants have been unusually ac-

            tive and efficient during the year in building up and caring for

            the collections in their respective departments, as is fully set

            forth in their respective reports.



            Department of Botany



            The herbarium of the California Academy of Sciences now numbers

            67,789 mounted specimens representing 18,825 species, an increase during

            the year of 8,200 specimens and almost 2,000 species. The chief accessions

            are as follows :



            By purchase. — 160 specimens from Rev. John Davis, collected in South

            Carolina, and 400 specimens from A. A. Heller, collected in northern

            California and southern Oregon.

            Through exchange. — 290 specimens from Ira W. Clokey, Denver, Colo-

            rado, collected in Colorado, and 220 specimens of California mosses

            collected by Dr. M. A. Howe ; also 300 duplicates from the Cosmo-

            politan Mitten Moss Herbarium, from the New York Botanical

            Garden.

            Sixty-eight different correspondents sent in specimens chiefly for identi-

            fication. The following are the most notable :

            Mr. Ellsworth Bethel, Denver, Colorado, 281 from Denver and 21 from

            California and Nevada; Mrs. Mary Strong Clemens, 150 from Yo-

            semite National Park and 401 from Plumas and Amador counties,

            California, and southern Oregon; J. August Kusche, 178 from

            Hawaiian Islands; Mrs. G. Earle Kelly, 65 from various parts of

            California; Mr. Vincent Jones, 72 from various parts of California;

            Mrs. Marian L. Campbell, 74 from various parts of California; Mrs.

            E. C. Sutliffe, 88 from various parts of California; Howard E.

            Phelps, 50 from Pullman, Washington; and Ira C. Otis, 74 from

            Cascade Mountains, Washington.

            The California State Floral Society gave a collection, chiefly of exotic

            ferns, made by the late Mrs. L. A. Hodgkins. It consists of 76 large

            mounted sheets and 171 smaller specimens, besides a small collection of

            flowering plants collected by the late George W. Dunn,



            Dr. G. Dallas Hanna, besides his own collection of 76 specimens from

            Unalaska, induced Miss Danforth and Miss Miller, two Unalaska teachers,

            to collect for the Academy, and they added 18 specimens. Mr. E. C.

            Johnston also collected 130 specimens and many duplicates on St. George

            Island at Dr. Hanna's suggestion. Mr. Eric Walther, who has been inde-

            fatigable in seeking for the different species cultivated in Golden Gate

            Park so as to label them under my supervision, has added about 450 speci-

            mens, chiefly exotics, many of them new to the collection.



            The curator spent a short time in April along the southern boundary

            of the state and collected 285 species and duplicates. During the visit in

            June to attend the meeting of the Pacific Division of the American Asso-

            ciation for the Advancement of Science at Seattle, a small collection of

            about ninety species was made around Seattle, and on a short trip to

            Victoria and Nanaimo, British Columbia, 247 species and duplicates were

            collected. Exceptional opportunities for collecting were given by the mem-

            bers of the British Columbia Biological Station, who offered both hospi-

            tality and guidance. Several small collections were made in Solano,

            Marin and San Francisco counties, chiefly in type localities.



            Much time has been spent in naming the trees and shrubs in Golden Gate

            Park so as to correctly label them. In order to facilitate this work, books

            not in the Academy library are greatly needed as the plants in the park

            come from all parts of the world. About 600 species have been named

            and labels attached to 2000 plants. Some of the genera, such as Acacia,

            Eucalyptus, Veronica, Escallonia, and the bamboos have been very diffi-

            cult. Duplicate specimens are being collected and prepared to send to the

            best authorities for verification of the identifications.



            The care of the growing herbarium takes much time, and a great deal

            of the detail work falls on the curator. This prevents the accomplishment

            of original work which should be done.



            The flower show in the vestibule fills a great want in the community.

            During the year hundreds of species of exotic and native plants are ex-

            hibited labelled with scientific and common name and native home. With-

            out the care and attention of Mrs. Johanna E. Wilkens it would be im-

            possible to keep this clean and attractive.



            The California Botanical Club has about 60 members and holds meetings

            once a week either at the Academy or on an excursion to some place near

            the city. Its members help the herbarium in many ways, particularly

            Mrs. Marian L. Campbell and Mrs. E. C. Sutlift'e, who bring in specimens

            continually for the herbarium and the flower show. Mrs. Enid Reeves

            Michaels, one of the members now residing in the Yosemite Valley, has

            been keeping up a flower show in the valley throughout the season, at

            her own expense and by her own efforts. Recently, the Club has pur-

            chased for the Museum 360 pictures of California wild flowers photo-

            graphed and colored with great skill and accuracy by Antone J. Soares.

            These will be installed soon so as to be on exhibition in the Museum.

            Carex have been sent to Kenneth M. Mackenzie, the authority at the New

            York Botanical Garden.



            Continually throughout the year, the Curator has given informal talks

            on botanical subjects to various clubs in San Francisco and other places in

            order to educate the public in the love of nature, the knowledge of our

            flora and the necessity of protecting our native vegetation from wanton

            destruction.



            The weekly class of the gardeners of the park is held in the evening at

            the herbarium. One of the members, Mr. Lewis Allen, has donated some

            fine photographs showing particular species of trees and shrubs in the

            park and all the members are most enthusiastic in bringing to the Academy

            all the new plants that are coming into flower or fruit. The collection of

            exotics raised in California out of doors that is gradually being accumu-

            lated in the herbarium of the Academy is one of its most important fea-

            tures and destined to make this herbarium the chief place of reference for

            the determination of exotics throughout the state.



            Alice Eastwood, Curator.



            Department of Entomology



            As during the preceding three years the significant work done in the

            department of entomology in 1920 was the accumulation and classification

            of the insects of the western United States. Some interesting exotic

            material has been secured, of special note being a collection of 3570 moths

            from the Hawaiian Islands and 1500 beetles from the Amazon Valley. In

            our local fauna most advance has been made in the Lepidoptera, Diptera

            and Hemiptera. In the Lepidoptera large additions have been made to the

            collection of night-flying moths, and, witlf the exception of the smaller

            forms or micro-lepidoptera, most of our species have been determined

            and several of the families rearranged. The Geometridae, especially, make

            an excellent showing with nearly 300 species, mostly from the west coast

            states. Determinations in this family have been made for us by Mr. W. S.

            Wright of San Diego and Mr. E. H. Blackmore of Victoria, B. C, both

            excellent authorities on these delicate and often beautiful "angle-wing"

            moths. Mr. E. A. Dodge of Santa Cruz and Mr. S. E. Cassino, of Salem,

            Mass., have given us many interesting forms of the genus Catocala, a

            group of showy moths with red or yellow underwings, of which the

            Academy now has 76 species. In the Diptera, or two-winged flies, much

            advance has been made. Mr. F. R. Cole, now at Stanford University, has

            been appointed associate curator in this order of insects and has done

            much to improve our collection by the determination and arrangement

            of our material. In this order the Academy collection now numbers 12,167

            specimens, representing 876 named species. At least nine-tenths of this

            material has been added during the past four years. During the year the

            curator has devoted considerable time to systematic work on the order

            Hemiptera, or true bugs, and our collection in this order is now in very

            good condition. Of these insects we now have 15,472 specimens, repre-

            senting 744 named species, with portions of two families yet to be worked

            up. As one result of his systematic work on the Hemiptera the curator

            has prepared descriptions of SO new species and one new genus which are

            awaiting more favorable conditions for publication. Academy material in

            the order Orthoptera, which includes the grasshoppers, crickets and their

            relatives, has been determined by Mr. Morgan Hebard of Philadelphia,

            who also has added many eastern forms to our collection. Unfortunately,

            the lack of cabinet boxes precludes the possibility of arranging these

            interesting insects this year. Large additions have been made to the col-

            lection of Coleoptera, or bettles, but the complete rearrangement of these

            insects has awaited the publication of the new Leng Catalogue of Coleop-

            tera.



            Accessions to the Academy's collection of insects during the year 1920

            number 24,861 specimens to which must be added 3,146 specimens in the

            Stretch collection, transferred as a permanent loan or deposit from the

            University of California, making a total of 28,007 additions for the year.

            Of this number, 9,525 were received as gifts from friends of the Academy,

            5,062 were obtained by purchase, 3,146 as a permanent loan and 10,274

            were added through field work by the curator. The mounting and labelling

            of this mass of material has consumed much of the time of the curator,

            although he was fortunate in having the help of Miss Helen Sanford for

            four months and of Mr. J. O. Martin for one month. Some of the prin-

            cipal gifts to this department received during the year were : from Mr.

            W. M. Giffard of Honolulu, 485 aculeate Hymenoptera from the Sierras;

            from Mr. Morgan Hebard of Philadelphia, 378 Orthoptera; from Mr. L.

            R. Reynolds, 138 Hemiptera from Mexico; from Maj. Chapman Grant of

            Oklahoma City, 150 insects ; from Mr. E. A. Dodge, 423 moths ; from Mr.

            C. L. Fox, 991 insects, largely from Siskiyou County, California; from

            Dr. E. C. Van Dyke 1717, mostly from the state of Washington; from

            Mr. J. E. Law, 450 from Arizona ; and from Dr. G. Dallas Hanna, 2441

            specimens from the Pribilof Islands, taken by him last summer, and per-

            haps the largest collection of insects ever taken on these islands at one

            time. Other valuable material has been received from Dr. F. E. Blaisdell,

            Mr. J. R. Leach, Dr. J. A. Comstock, Mr. J. O. Martin, Mr. S. E. Cassino,

            Mrs. E. P. Van Duzee, Mrs. H. E. Ricksecker, Mr. L. S. Slevin, Mr. J. R.

            Slevin, Mr. F. X. Williams, Mr. C. Howard Curran, Dr. R. Ottolengui and

            Mr. B. G. Thompson.



            The field work of the curator during 1920 consisted of a trip to Half

            Moon Bay, April 12 to 13; a trip by automobile to San Diego. April 19 to

            28, as guest of Mr. W. M. Giff ard ; one to Bryson, Monterey County, May

            16 to 23; one to Sacramento, June 2 to 3, as guest of Mr. Giffard ; a trip

            to Seattle and Forks, Washington and Vancouver Island, B. C, June 14

            to July 14, and one to Santa Cruz, November 3 to 4, as guest of Mr. E. A.

            Dodge. In addition several short Sunday trips to nearby points have been

            taken and many evenings have been spent collecting moths at light about

            store windows in the city ; and, thanks to the kindness of Miss Alice East-

            wood, the curator was able to make use of her cottage on the slopes of Mt.

            Tamalpais for night collecting of moths during the whole month of March.

            Vol. X] EVERMANN— DIRECTOR'S REPORT FOR 1920 141



            This department has received assistance in the determination of material

            from a number of specialists besides those already mentioned and has

            rendered assistance to others, principally by the determination of Hemip-

            tera. The curator, during the past year, as a part of the work of his

            department, has been in more or less regular correspondence with over

            125 individuals, mostly workers in the science of entomology.



            But one paper by the curator has been published during 1920. This

            was issued as Vol. 9, No. 13, of the Proceedings of the Academy and

            contains descriptions of 28 new species of North American Hemiptera.

            Several later papers await opportunity for publication.



            It is expected that the energies and resources of this department for the

            coming year largely will be absorbed by the proposed Academy expedition

            to Lower California and in the preparation and study of the material taken.



            E. P. Van Duzee, Curator.



            Department of Herpetology



            The Department of Herpetology during the year 1920 progressed satis-

            factorily, and the work accomplished compares favorably with that of

            previous years.



            At the beginning of the year 1920 the Academy's collection of reptiles

            and amphibians numbered 40,038 specimens. There have been added dur-

            ing the year 1,466 specimens, so that the collection has grown to more

            than 41,000 specimens.



            The number of specimens added during each of the past six years has

            been about as follows :



            1915 800 specimens



            1916 1500



            1917 ^ 1600



            1918 1724



            1919 2666



            1920 1466



            Gifts of specimens during the year have been received as follows :

            The classification and arrangement of the collection was continued dur-

            ing part of the year.



            Considerable research work has been accomplished during the year and

            a further study of the gopher-snakes west of the Rocky Mountains has been

            published.



            The snakes of the genus Lampropeltis were borrowed for study by Dr.

            Blanchard, and the lizards of the genus Gerrhonotus were studied by Mr.

            Ivan Johnston. Other students also made use of the collection.



            During the year the Assistant Curator, Mr. J. R. Slevin, carried on ex-

            plorations in California and Arizona, where he spent the months of May,

            June, July, August, and part of September, and secured large collections.

            Vol. X] EVERMANN— DIRECTOR'S REPORT FOR 1920 143



            Department of Invertebrate Paleontology



            The regular work of the Department of Invertebrate Paleontology is

            considerably varied in character because of the assembling therein of all

            the collections of fossil animals and plants, as well as those of the shells

            of living mollusks, and corals and the minerals, which belong to the Acad-

            emy. While each group must necessarily receive a certain amount of care

            in order to make the collections readily accessible for study, the greatest

            attention of the personnel of the Department has been given to the living

            and fossil mollusks, particularly the latter. The vast Tertiary deposits of

            these organisms in California have attracted the attention of members

            of the Academy's staflf since the organization of the institution. Although

            the valuable collections obtained prior to 1906 were destroyed in the fire,

            the activities of my predecessors and friends of the Academy have resulted

            in the building up of one of the largest West Coast series in existence.

            In the careful selection of the specimens and their orderly arrangement

            the collection is second to none.



            The study of the fossil shells necessitates having related living forms

            for comparison, and generous friends have presented material from time

            to time, so that a very large and valuable working series of recent shells

            has been obtained. So far as West Coast material is concerned, the

            Academy's collection probably ranks third in importance at the present

            time.



            Some specimens of fossil vertebrate animals are also contained in the

            collections, but throughout its history the Academy has preferred to leave

            this branch of the work to other institutions. This likewise has been true

            with regards to the fossil plants and the minerals.



            Such varied and extensive collections require attention along the follow-

            ing lines: (1) The collection of additional material in the most important

            groups (field work) ; (2) The proper accessioning, cataloging, and classify-

            ing of the specimens; (3) The preparation and publishing of reports upon

            the collections for the use of the members of the Academy and others

            interested in this branch of science.



            Three important field trips were made by the curator during the period

            covered by this report. Ten days in April were spent in San Benito

            County, California, in company with Mr. Joseph Mailliard, Curator of the

            Department of Ornithology. The collections of land and freshwater mol-

            lusks secured filled important gaps in our series. Search for fossils in

            the region proved unsuccessful.



            The United States Bureau of Fisheries requested the services of the

            curator during the summer of 1920 to take the census of Alaska fur seals

            on the Pribilof Islands, a task to which he had been detailed annually since

            1913. After careful consideration of the benefits which the Academy would

            derive from such a trip, it was decided best to accede to the wishes of the

            Bureau. The curator, therefore, took his departure on May 27, and,

            after an absence of about four months, returned on October 1. About

            one month of this time was occupied with actual fur-seal work, and the

            remaining available time was devoted to making collections in the branches

            in which the Academy personnel is most interested. Besides the work

            done on the Pribilof Islands, specimens were obtained at Seattle, Un-

            alaska, and Woody Island, near Kodiak, Alaska. Land and freshwater

            shells were secured at these places, and dredging was done whenever

            weather conditions would permit. The Department of Invertebrate

            Paleontology thus secured 3,000 specimens. In addition to these collections

            the attempted boring of an artesian well on St. Paul Island by the Navy

            Department furnished an opportunity to secure a continuous series of

            cuttings down to 100 feet below sea level. A very large collection of fossil

            diatoms thus resulted, the full importance and extent of which can not

            be estimated at this time.



            The collections of birds, birds' eggs, insects and plants secured on this

            trip have been dealt with by the curators of the respective departments.



            During the latter part of 1920 the Bureau of Fisheries made a further

            request for the presence of the curator at a conference on fur-seal matters,

            called for January 10, 1921, in Washington, D. C. That this request might

            be complied with, two weeks annual leave was granted. Entire approval

            was expressed with regard to the methods of census computation developed

            by the writer.



            On the return from Washington a brief stop was made at Austin, Texas,

            where a large collection of recent land and freshwater shells, and marine

            Cretaceous fossils was secured. At the close of the year these specimens

            had not been assorted or classified.



            The trip to Washington and return on Government transportation

            furnished an opportunity, which could not be overlooked, to visit an im-

            portant, but little-known. Tertiary horizon in southern California at little

            expense to the Academy. This is in the general region of Carriso Creek,

            Imperial and San Diego counties. Dr. Roy E. Dickerson, the former

            curator, had borrowed the material from this locality which had been

            collected by the U. S. Geological Survey and the University of California,

            but had been unable to complete the study he contemplated. Upon looking

            into the matter with a view to returning the borrowed collections to their

            owners, their importance from a geological standpoint was very evident.

            Professor Bruce L. Clark, of the University of California, urged that the

            relations of the fossil fauna be determined, if possible. The best preserved

            specimens of the various species were accordingly taken to Washington,

            where direct comparisons could be made with closely related species from

            the West Indies and other places.



            It then appeared more evident than ever that this deposit of shells and

            other fossils promised to reveal many unknown facts regarding the former

            connection of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. A larger collection and

            better material were imperative; and at the time this report is being writ-

            ten, field work is in progress, and it is hoped that before it goes to press

            it will be possible to state briefly the success of the undertaking.



            Besides the collections made by the curator, some others should be

            mentioned. Dr. Roy E. Dickerson brought to the Academy in 1920 an

            extensive series of marine shells from the Philippine Islands. Altogether

            there are 1,470 specimens. Mr. Joseph R. Slevin brought some rare land

            shells from Arizona, where exploration was conducted in the interests

            of the Department of Herpetology. Dr. Barton Warren Evermann col-

            lected some beautiful specimens of lavas while he was in the Hawaiian

            Islands attending the meeting of the Pan-Pacific Scientific Conference.

            Several other minor collections were donated to the Academy, all of

            which are mentioned in the list of accessions following.



            The proper cataloging and classification of a collection is almost as valu-

            able work as the assembling of it, hence a great deal of attention has been

            devoted to this work. The card system is being used to list the various

            species, numbers of specimens, localities, etc., and an important beginning

            has been made upon a real inventory of the scientific material in the

            Department. Once this is completed there will be little difficulty in keeping

            it up to date ; and, then in a short time, it will be possible to state how many

            species and specimens we have. At the present time this can not be

            done, although it would be very desirable.



            The absence of the curator in Alaska for so long, prevented the writ-

            ing of many papers on the collections. However, the work upon the

            Miocene freshwater shells from the ancient Petaluma Lake was com-

            pleted. Also two reports upon fossil land shells of an Oregon deposit

            were written. Altogether the curator published six articles during the

            year.



            Considerable progress was made in the indexing of references to west

            American land and freshwater mollusks. From the vast intricacies of

            the literature which thus become orderly assembled, it is hoped that a

            valid list of species may be extricated. One of the things already dis-

            closed is the remarkable fact that no less than 125 specific and subspecific

            names have been applied in the common Califgrnia land-snail genus, known

            as Epiphragmophora.



            Our collection has continued to be actively used by other institutions,

            and it is hoped that in the future it will continue to prove equally at-

            tractive. Specimens which have been studied by specialists are believed

            to be of far greater value to a museum than those which repose in-

            definitely unidentified and untouched in their cases.



            Under the able leadership of Professor Clark, the students of his

            classes in paleontology have found material collected by the Academy per-

            sonnel many years ago, of great value in their work upon particular hori-

            zons. This is especially true of Mr. Howe, who is engaged upon faunas

            from Oregon and Washington. It is understood, informally, that the

            monograph of the western species of the genus TurritcUa by Miss Richard-

            son has been completed, and that the material borrowed from the Academy

            will be returned as soon as the necessary photographs have been taken.



            Miss Mary J. Rathbun, Associate in Zoology of the U. S. National

            Museum, has borrowed the Academy's collection of fossil crabs. She is

            the foremost authority on these crustaceans, and it is fortunate that our

            material may be identified by such an able and well-known student.



            Dr. T. Wayland Vaughan, of the U. S. Geological Survey, visited the

            Academy in the summer of 1920, and requested the loan of some of our

            Tertiary fossils to be used in connection with his studies of coastal plains

            geology. Others who have borrowed certain specified groups in past

            years, but who have not completed their studies at this date, are : Dr.

            Earl L. Packard, University of Oregon, Cretaceous fossils ; Dr. S. S.

            Berry, Redlands, California, Chitons ; and Dr. W. S. W. Kew, fossil sea

            urchins.



            Faithful and very valuable assistance has been rendered in the Depart-

            ment by Messrs. Merle Israelsky and Georges Vorbe, students of the

            University of California, and by Mr. William Barbat of St. Mary's College.



            G. Dallas Hanna, Curator.



            Department of Invertebrate Zoology



            The collections have been increased by specimens collected by the

            Curator and Mr. W. S. Wallace of Monterey Bay. Mr. Wallace has

            specialized on hydroids and is naming the material as rapidly as acquired.



            A trip to Vancouver Island which the Curator had intended to make in

            October had to be postponed until April on account of unfavorable tides

            and the closing of the Nanaimo Biological Station, which was to be used

            as a base of operations. The primary object of the trip was to study in

            life the shore and shallow-water sea stars, of which a considerable num-

            ber of nominal forms have been described from that general region.



            Dr. G. Dallas Hanna made a collection of sea stars, with extensive color

            notes, at St. Paul Island, Bering Sea, and at Unalaska, during the summer.



            Dr. Gertrude Van Wagenen, who is studying at the Hopkins Marine

            Station, the corals and actinians of Monterey Bay, will contribute a set of

            named specimens. W. K. Fisher, Curator.



            Librarian's Report



            The growth of the library during the year 1920 was greater than during

            the preceding year, accessions having increased by purchase, by exchange

            and by gift. The low rate of foreign exchange made it seem advisable to

            place larger orders with European dealers and by this means many valu-

            able sets were received at a very reasonable figure. Recovery from the

            European War has made possible the resumption of exchanges with many

            foreign societies, and lastly, more than the usual number of gifts have

            been received from friends of the Academy. Accessions to the library

            for the year number 1370 bound volumes, of which 526 were received by

            gift, 544 by purchase and 300 through exchange with other institutions.

            In addition to the bound volumes a large number of pamphlets and parts

            of volumes were received. By far the larger part of the books and pam-

            phlets presented to the Academy library were from the Adolph Sutro

            library, received through the generosity of Doctors Geo. W. and Emma

            Sutro Merritt. This material from the Sutro library includes 402 bound

            volumes and 4248 miscellaneous numbers of government bulletins and

            reports and similar unbound material, besides a large number of separate

            papers, many of which will be useful later in completing sets. During

            the year 2200 volumes were accessioned, making the total number of

            volumes accessioned on December 31, 1920, 14,080.

            Vol. X] EVERM ANN— DIRECTOR'S REPORT FOR 1920 147



            Two new metal book stacks were erected in the basement library room,

            furnishing shelving space for 2400 volumes. This additional shelving

            has made it possible to relieve and rearrange some overcrowded subjects,

            thus adding materially to the orderly arrangement of the books stored in

            the basement room.



            Work in the library department has, as in the two previous years, been

            in the hands of Miss McClellan and Mrs. Van Duzee, and to the faithful

            and efficient performance of the duties devolving upon these two is due

            the progress made in this department of the Academy's activities.



            The collating, classification and cataloging has been completed in the

            series of publications of scientific societies and institutions issued in for-

            eign languages, and in the subjects of engineering, chemistry, geography,

            mathematics, medicine, mining, ethnology and archaeology and work on

            several other subjects is nearing completion. All current accessions also

            have been cataloged and placed on the shelves promptly as received. Use

            of the library by the Academy membership has shown a gratifying in-

            crease and it is hoped that with the improvement of the catalogue and

            the more systematic arrangement of the books on the shelves will come

            an increasing and more effective use of the books we have, both by the

            museum staff and the Academy membership in general.



            E. P. Van Duzee, Assistant Librarian.



            Department of Mammalogy



            As heretofore, this department has been coordinated with that of Or-

            nithology, and what field work was accomplished was done incidentally

            with that in the latter department.



            A succession of dry seasons in northern California made the collecting

            of small rodents a difficult matter on account of their scarcity, but a con-

            siderable number was obtained.



            The Academy's collection of mammals had never been completely

            checked up, labelled, or entered upon the accession register, but this work

            is now nearly finished. Many of the large skins were only salted or dried,

            but the necessity for the better preservation of these very valuable speci-

            mens became so evident that Mr. H. W. Vogelsang was employed to tan

            them. The larger proportion of these have been so treated with most

            satisfactory results.



            These skins have heretofore been stored in the ordinary metal cases in

            use for the smaller mammals, and therefore not readily accessible. It

            was decided to build a hide room in which to hang them when tanned.

            For this purpose a space has been enclosed in the vacant store room at

            the northwest corner of the Mammal Hall, in which all hides will be

            easily accessible for examination.



            Gifts to the department have been made by Messrs. F. S. Townsley,

            J. R. Slevin, Chas. Budd, Geo. A. Bailey, W. C. Hackmeier, Dr. Saxton

            Pope, the Golden Gate Park authorities, and others, as shown in the List

            of Accessions.

            148 CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES [Proc. 4th Ser.



            Department of Ornithology



            Active work in this department has been carried on throughout the

            year. While most of this work has consisted in the classification, regis-

            tration, and arrangement of specimens, several field trips were undertaken

            and some valuable contributions made to the knowledge of the distribu-

            tion and migration of our birds. Two weeks in the early spring were

            spent in Monterey County, California, for the purpose of observing the

            unusual influx of Clarke's Nutcrackers reported from there, and for

            studying the j uncos pf that part of the state, and some valuable records

            were obtained. Another field trip was made in company with Dr. G.

            Dallas Hanna, of the Department of Paleontology, to whose valuable

            assistance this department is greatly indebted, into the region near "The

            Pinnacles," San Benito County, California, and to Pacheco and Panoche

            passes in order to note migrations. Interesting data were secured on this

            trip in connection with the spring migration of certain species and many

            specimens of birds and eggs were brought back.



            The principal field trip of the year was to Siskiyou County, California,

            made in company with Mr. F. G. Gilchrist and Mr. Frank C. Holman, as

            assistants. Five weeks were passed in the field, the greater portion in

            camp at various spots. Although the very dry season had an unfortunate

            influence upon the bird life of the localities visited, the expedition gath-

            ered a number of specimens from a but little investigated part of the

            state, better defined the known habitats of several species of birds, and

            obtained some good records. The regions visited were localities west

            and north of the base of Mt. Shasta; Forest House Mountain, west of

            Yreka; and the Salmon Mountains, west of Greenview. Thanks are

            especially due to Mr. F. C. Holman, in the capacity of volunteer assistant,

            for his efforts to make the expedition a success.



            Another field trip was made, in company with Mr. Chase Littlejohn,

            present assistant in this department, to the Mt. St. Helena range in Lake

            County, California, further to study the fall migration of fox sparrows.

            Fifteen days were spent in this work, and some very interesting observa-

            tions were made, and numerous specimens secured.



            The Curatorial work of the department has been principally that of

            cataloging and arranging specimens and bringing the card index up to

            date. The large increase in the number of specimens has necessitated the

            addition of fifteen metal cases for their installation, but, unless the near

            future brings unexpected fortune in the way of large donations, there

            should now be case room for the coming year, especially as a few cases

            will be freed from the mammalogical room.



            The illness of Mr. Wm. Heim, who was mounting birds for the sea-

            sonal groups of the birds of Golden Gate Park, has delayed that work

            so that it is not yet systematically arranged, but a number of the birds

            of the park are in the cases, properly labelled, so that the public may

            profit thereby. Mr. Littlejohn has more specimens under way, and it is

            hoped to have these groups in fairly good shape within the next few

            weeks.



            The principal donation to the department during the past year has been

            that of the W. Otto Emerson collection of study skins, consisting of some

            5300 specimens, the life work of Mr. Emerson. This collection was pur-

            chased and donated to the Academy by Messrs. W. H. Crocker and John

            W. Mailliard. In this collection are many rare records for California,

            and, with the Mailliard collection, the Academy's representation of

            the land birds of this state is now placed on a good working basis for

            the use of all who may be interested in the study of ornithology.

            Accessions to the Department of Ornithology proper are as follows :

            great deal of work has been accomplished in the matter of rearranging

            the collection of birds for the reception of the large additions ; and the

            installment of the oological collection is proceeding with reasonable speed.

            it is properly drawn up so as to exhibit a true and correct view of the

            Academy's affairs, as shown by the books.
