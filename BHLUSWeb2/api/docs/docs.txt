Biodiversity Heritage Library
API v1 Documentation
Created: April 6, 2010
Revised: 

The methods documented here map directly to the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) "Name Services" 
(which are documented at http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dgvjvvkz_1x5qbm3); they accept exactly the same 
parameters and return exactly the same information.  The "Name Services" endpoints should now be 
considered deprecated, and if you wish to continue using those methods you should instead use the 
endpoints documented below.

These methods also exist in version 2 of the BHL API, though their signatures and return values have
changed slightly.  If possible, please migrate your applications to version 2 of the API.

*** HTTP QUERY INTERFACE ***

The HTTP query interface to the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) API exposes methods for extracting
data using HTTP GET requests.

AUTHENTICATION

No authentication is required for version 1 of the BHL API.

OUTPUT TYPES

Results can be returned in either XML or JSON format.  To return XML, append &format=xml to the method 
call.  To return JSON, append &format=json to the method call.  If a format is not specified, XML is 
returned.

An example of returning XML is https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/api/httpquery.ashx?op=<method>...&format=xml

An example of returning JSON is https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/api/httpquery.ashx?op=<method>...&format=json

CALLBACKS

If you need to capture the results of a method call with a callback function, specific the name of the 
callback function by appending &callback=<function name> to the method call.

For example, https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/api/httpquery.ashx?op=<method>...&callback=<function name>

STATUS CODE

Each method response contains a status code that indicates the success or failure of the method call.  
This code is contained in the "Status" field of the response.  The valid status codes are:

	ok - the method executed successfully
	error - an error occurred while executing the method; check the ErrorMessage field for details

METHODS

Specify the name of the API method being called with the "op=<method name>" argument.  For example, 
https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/api2/httpquery.ashx?op=<method name>

NameCount:

	Return the number of unique names (that have been assigned NameBank identifiers) found on pages in BHL.  

	Example - https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/api/httpquery.ashx?op=NameCount&startdate=10/15/2009&enddate=10/31/2009

	startdate - (optional) start date of range between which to count names
	enddate - (optional) end date of range between which to count names

NameList:

	List the unique names (that have been assigned NameBank identifiers).  By using the startrow and 
	batchsize parameters appropriately, you can pull the list all at once, or in batches (i.e. 1000 
	names at a time).

	Example - https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/api/httpquery.ashx?op=NameList&startrow=1&batchsize=1000&startdate=10/15/2009&enddate=10/31/2009

	startrow - first name to return (if are returning names in batches of 100, specify startrow=1
				for the first batch, startrow=101 for the second batch, and so on
	batchsize - number of names to return
	startdate - (optional) start date of range between which to count names
	enddate - (optional) end date of range between which to count names

NameGetDetail:

	Get basic title, item, and page metadata for each page on which the specified name appears.

	Example - https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/api/httpquery.ashx?op=NameGetDetail&namebankid=3501464

	namebankid - NameBank identifier for a name

NameSearch:

	Search for a particular name.  Only names that have been assigned NameBank identifiers are returned.

	Example - https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/api/httpquery.ashx?op=NameSearch&name=poa+annua

	name - a partial or complete name string

*** SOAP INTERFACE ***

The SOAP interface to the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) API exposes methods for extracting
data using SOAP requests.  The WSDL document for the API is available at this location:
https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/api/soap.asmx?wsdl

AUTHENTICATION

No authentication is required for version 1 of the BHL API.

METHODS

The SOAP methods that are available generally map to the methods exposed by the HTTP query interface.
The methods names are listed below, and a complete description of each method can be found by browsing
the information found at https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/api/soap.asmx.
