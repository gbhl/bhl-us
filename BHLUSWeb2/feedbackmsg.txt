[Feedback]

BHL is voluntarily staffed by our Partner Libraries (http://biodivlib.wikispaces.com/BHL+Consortium). We are limited in our ability to respond personally to each contact with our patrons. We appreciate your patience. A BHL staff member may contact you if we require further information or clarification.

In the meantime, you may find useful information on our Help Pages (http://biodivlib.wikispaces.com/help). For example:

*  When will the title I requested be available in BHL? What is the Scan Request process?
*  How can I download a book / series of pages / single image from BHL?
*  Can I reuse your images? If I do, how would BHL like me to attribute them?
*  What link should I use when I cite BHL items in my published research?
*  Where can I find information about supporting the BHL as an individual or institution?

Thank you for your continued use and support of the Biodiversity Heritage Library. We appreciate your feedback!

With thanks,
