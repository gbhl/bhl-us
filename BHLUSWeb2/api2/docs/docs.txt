*** HTTP QUERY INTERFACE ***

The HTTP query interface to the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) API exposes methods for extracting
data using HTTP GET requests.

AUTHENTICATION

To use the BHL API you must supply an API Key value with each request.  To obtain a key, go to 
http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/getapikey.aspx.  The same key can be used for both the HTTP
Query interface and the SOAP interface.

To include the key value with a request, append the argument &apikey=<key value> to the method call.  
For example, http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/api2/httpquery.ashx?op=<method>...&apikey=<key value>

OUTPUT TYPES

Results can be returned in either XML or JSON format.  To return XML, append &format=xml to the method 
call.  To return JSON, append &format=json to the method call.  If a format is not specified, XML is 
returned.

An example of returning XML is http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/api2/httpquery.ashx?op=<method>...&apikey=<key value>&format=xml

An example of returning JSON is http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/api2/httpquery.ashx?op=<method>...&apikey=<key value>&format=json

CALLBACKS

If you need to capture the results of a method call with a callback function, specific the name of the 
callback function by appending &callback=<function name> to the method call.

For example, http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/api2/httpquery.ashx?op=<method>...&apikey=<key value>&callback=<function name>

STATUS CODE

Each method response contains a status code that indicates the success or failure of the method call.  
This code is contained in the "Status" field of the response.  The valid status codes are:

	ok - the method executed successfully
	error - an error occurred while executing the method; check the ErrorMessage field for details
	unauthorized - the specified api key is invalid or does not have permission to execute the method

*** SOAP INTERFACE ***

The SOAP interface to the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) API exposes methods for extracting
data using SOAP requests.  The WSDL document for the API is available at this location:
http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/api2/soap.asmx?wsdl

AUTHENTICATION

To use the BHL API you must supply an API Key value with each request.  To obtain a key, go to 
http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/getapikey.aspx.  The same key can be used for both the HTTP
Query interface and the SOAP interface.

METHODS

The SOAP methods that are available generally map to the methods exposed by the HTTP query interface.
The methods names are listed below, and a complete description of each method can be found by browsing
the information found at http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/api2/soap.asmx.
